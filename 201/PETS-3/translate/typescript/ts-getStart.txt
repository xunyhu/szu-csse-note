TypeScript for the New Programmer

Congratulations on choosing TypeScript as one of your first languages — you’re already making good decisions!
You’ve probably already heard that TypeScript is a “flavor” or “variant” of JavaScript. The relationship between TypeScript (TS) and JavaScript (JS) is rather unique among modern programming languages, so learning more about this relationship will help you understand how TypeScript adds to JavaScript.

祝贺您选择 TypeScript 作为您的首选语言之一——您已经做出了正确的决定！
您可能已经听说过 TypeScript 是 JavaScript 的“风味”或“变体”。 TypeScript (TS) 和 JavaScript (JS) 之间的关系在现代编程语言中相当独特，因此更多地了解这种关系将有助于您了解 TypeScript 如何添加到 JavaScript 中。

What is JavaScript? A Brief History
JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browsers. 
At the time it was invented, it was expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page — writing more than a few dozen lines of code would have been somewhat unusual. 
Due to this, early web browsers executed such code pretty slowly. 
Over time, though, JS became more and more popular, and web developers started using it to create interactive experiences.

JavaScript（也称为 ECMAScript）最初是一种用于浏览器的简单脚本语言。
在它被发明的时候，它被期望用于嵌入网页的短代码片段——编写超过几十行的代码有点不寻常。
因此，早期的网络浏览器执行此类代码的速度非常慢。
不过，随着时间的推移，JS 变得越来越流行，Web 开发人员开始使用它来创建交互式体验。
