Sebastian Steudtner has turned to science as he chases the world’s biggest waves

Sebastian Steudtner holds the world record for the biggest wave ever surfed. At 26.21 meters (86 feet), 
it is equivalent to surfing an eight-story building.
Sebastian Steudtner保持着有史以来最大海浪的世界纪录。它高26.21米（86英尺），相当于在一栋八层楼的建筑上冲浪。

The record was set in the picturesque Portuguese fishing village of Nazaré, whose north beach has been hailed as the Mount Everest of 
big-wave surfing having been home to seven of the tallest 10 waves ever surfed.
这一纪录是在风景如画的葡萄牙渔村拿撒勒创下的，那里的北海滩被誉为大浪冲浪的珠穆朗玛峰，有史以来最高的10个海浪中有7个是这里的所在地。

The German is a central figure in an international community of surfers who relocate to the west coast of Portugal each year for the season, 
which spans from October to March.
德国人是国际冲浪者群体的核心人物，他们每年都会在10月至3月的这个季节搬到葡萄牙西海岸。

But there is a method behind the 37-year-old’s apparent madness – he’s something of a surfing scientist in his approach to tackling 
the world’s roughest seas.
但这位37岁的年轻人明显的疯狂背后有一种方法——他在应对世界上最汹涌的海洋方面有点像冲浪科学家。
