Clashes erupted north of Sudan’s capital Khartoum on Wednesday night, upending a temporary ceasefire between the Sudanese Army and its rival, the Rapid Support Force, just hours after it was struck.

The two factions have been battling for days, and Wednesday saw fierce fighting in central Khartoum as well as serious clashes at the capital’s main airport.

Elon Musk's SpaceX company's mammoth new rocket, Starship, has exploded on its maiden flight.

No-one was hurt in the uncrewed test that lifted off from Texas' coast on Thursday morning local time.

After two to three minutes into the flight, the rocket - the biggest ever developed - started to tumble out of control and was soon destroyed by onboard charges.

Mr Musk has said his company will try again in a couple of months.

SpaceX engineers still class Thursday's mission as a success. They like to "test early and often" and are not afraid to break things. They will have gathered a mass of data to work towards the next flight. A second Starship is almost ready to take flight.

"Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months," Mr Musk tweeted.

埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 的 SpaceX 公司的巨型新型火箭星际飞船 (Starship) 在其首飞中爆炸。

当地时间周四上午，无人驾驶测试从德克萨斯州海岸起飞，无人受伤。

飞行两到三分钟后，有史以来最大的火箭开始失控坠落，很快就被机载炸药摧毁。

马斯克先生表示，他的公司将在几个月后再次尝试。

SpaceX 工程师仍然认为周四的任务是成功的。 他们喜欢“尽早且经常测试”并且不怕破坏东西。 他们将收集大量数据来为下一次飞行工作。 第二艘星际飞船即将起飞。

“祝贺@SpaceX 团队进行了激动人心的星际飞船试射！为几个月后的下一次试射学到了很多东西，”马斯克先生在推特上写道。

India is set to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation, with almost 3 million more people by the middle of this year, data released by the United Nations on Wednesday showed.

Based on the projections, India’s population by mid-year will reach 1.4286 billion, compared to China’s 1.4257 billion – 2.9 million fewer – according to the United Nations Population Fund’s (UNFPA) “State of World Population Report” for 2023.

UN officials have said it is not possible to determine the exact date for the shift, due to “uncertainty” about the data coming from China and India. India’s last census was in 2011 and most recent, scheduled in 2021, was delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The United States is a very distant third, with an estimated population of 340 million, the data, which reflects information available as of February, showed.

By 2050, eight countries will account for half the projected growth in global population: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania, according to the UNFPA report.

Beijing’s leaders have sought to downplay the significance of being overtaken by India.

“A country’s demographic dividend depends not only on the total number, but also on the quality; not only on the population, but also on the talent,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters Wednesday when asked about the latest UN projection.

联合国周三公布的数据显示，到今年年中，印度将超过中国成为世界上人口最多的国家，人口将增加近 300 万。

根据联合国人口基金 (UNFPA) 的 2023 年“世界人口状况报告”，根据预测，到年中印度的人口将达到 14.286 亿，而中国的人口为 14.257 亿，减少了 290 万。

联合国官员表示，由于来自中国和印度的数据存在“不确定性”，因此无法确定转变的确切日期。 印度上一次人口普查是在 2011 年，而最近一次原定于 2021 年进行的人口普查在 Covid-19 大流行期间被推迟。

数据显示，美国排在第三位，估计人口为 3.4 亿，该数据反映了截至 2 月份的可用信息。

根据人口基金的报告，到 2050 年，八个国家将占全球人口预计增长的一半：刚果民主共和国 (DRC)、埃及、埃塞俄比亚、印度、尼日利亚、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和坦桑尼亚。

北京领导人试图淡化被印度超越的重要性。

“一个国家的人口红利不仅取决于总量，更取决于质量； 不仅是人口，还有人才，”外交部发言人王文斌周三在被问及联合国最新预测时告诉记者。

Kenya on Saturday marked a new milestone in space exploration by launching the first satellite dubbed "Taifa 1" into space after three botched attempts linked to bad weather.

Developed by nine Kenya engineers, the observation satellite blasted off aboard SpaceX's Falcon-9 full-thrust rocket from Space Launch Complex 4E(SLC-4E), at Vandenberg Space Force Base in the United States of America.

The launch of Taifa 1 was described by the Kenya Space Agency as a historic milestone, amid efforts to harness space science to tackle present-day ecological challengens like the climate crisis.

Taifa is a Swahili word meaning "nation" in English.

The satellite will also collect agricultural data, monitor wildfires and aid local efforts to combat food insecurity while strengthening disaster management, noted Kenya Space Agency.

Its launch after three failed attempts last week linked to unfavorable upper-level wind conditions according to Kenya Space Agency is expected to revitalize the push for space exploration in Africa.

肯尼亚周六标志着太空探索的一个新里程碑，在与恶劣天气有关的三次失败尝试后，将第一颗名为“Taifa 1”的卫星发射到太空。

这颗观测卫星由 9 名肯尼亚工程师开发，由 SpaceX 的 Falcon-9 全推力火箭从美利坚合众国范登堡太空部队基地的 4E 航天发射场 (SLC-4E) 发射升空。

Taifa 1 号的发射被肯尼亚航天局描述为一个历史性的里程碑，它正在努力利用空间科学来应对当今的生态挑战，如气候危机。

Taifa 是一个斯瓦希里语单词，在英语中意为“民族”。

肯尼亚航天局指出，该卫星还将收集农业数据、监测野火并帮助当地努力应对粮食不安全，同时加强灾害管理。

根据肯尼亚航天局的说法，在上周三次尝试失败后，它的发射与不利的上层风力条件有关，预计将重振非洲太空探索的推动力。
