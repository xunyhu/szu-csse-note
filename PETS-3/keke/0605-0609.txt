United States lawmakers approved the bill to raise America's debt ceiling on Thursday, allowing the government to avert a disastrous credit default by borrowing more.

America spends more money than it collects through taxation, so it borrows money via the issuing of government bonds.

Lawmakers introduced a limit on how much federal debt could be accrued, but the ceiling has been raised for the 103rd time since 1945. The debt stands at around $31.5 trillion, 
more than 120 percent of the U.S. GDP.

Both parties see raising the debt limit as politically toxic, 
although they acknowledge that failure to do so would plunge the U.S. economy into a depression and roil world markets if the government misses debt repayments.
