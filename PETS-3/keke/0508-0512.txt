President Joe Biden's administration will temporarily send 1500 additional troops to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border, the Pentagon said on Tuseday,
in preparation for a possible rise in illegal immigration when COVID-19 border restrictions lift later this month.

The 90-day deployment of active-duty troops will supplement the work of the U.S. Border Patrol but not carry out law enforcement duties, 
Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Pat Ryder said in a statement.

The so-called Title 42 restrictions, set to end on May 11， allow U.S. authorities to rapidly expel non-Mexican migrants to Mexico without the chance to seek asylum.
Biden, a Democrat running for reelection in 2024, has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S-Mexico border since he took office in 2021.
