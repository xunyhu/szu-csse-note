- The extraordinary rise of living alone is the biggest social change that we've neglected to identify, let along examine.

- Consider that in 1950, a mere 4 million Americans lived alone, making up only 9% of households. Back then, living alone was most common in the Western states that attracted seasonal workingmen, ant it was usually a short-lived stage on the road to a more conventional domestic life.

- Not anymore. According to the latest data, nearly 33 million Americans live alone, making up 28% of households, which means they are now tied with clildless couples as the most important type, more common than the nuclear family, the multi generational family and the roommate or group home. These aren't just temporary living situtions: over a five-year period, people who live alone are more likely to remain in their current state than anyone else except married couples with children. They're concentrated in big cities throughout the country.

- Living alone, being along and feeling lonely are hardly the same, yet in recent years experts have mixed them up, raising fears that the rise of living alone signals the ultimate atomization of the modern world. In fact, there's little evidence that the rise of living alone is making more Americans lonely. According to the latest studies, what matters is not whether we live alone but whether we feel alone. Divorced people often say there's nothing lonelier than living with the wrong person. Besides, people living alone compensate by becoming more socially active than those who live with others.

- The truth is, today nearly everyone who lives alone chooses to do so, desplite less expensive options from finding roommates to living with family.

- After all, living alone allows us to do what we want, when we want, on our own terms. It liberates us from the restrictions of domestic partner's needs and demands. Today, in our age of digital media and ever expanding social networks, living alone can offer even greater benefits：the time and space for healing power of aloneness.

- This means that living alone can help us discover who we are and what gives us meaning and purpose. It might be exactly what we need to reconnect.

- If you've traveled by airplane in the pase few years, chances are you've walked through a full body scanner at the security checkpoint.

- The first generation of full body X-ray scanners rolled out in airports across the US in 2008. Known as backsatter scanners, there was a bit of an uproar from consumers when these came on the scene. Fliers feared the imagin would visually strip them of their clothers in front of the Transportation Security Administration(TSA) agents. Some health experts alse worried that these models might expose people to unnecessary radiation.

- But in 2013, the TSA replaced backscatter scanners with new-and-improved scanners, called millimeter wave screeners. They fixd the "see you naked"issue. These devices create a standard outline of a person, rather than a detailed image of the perpon's body. The're also an improvement for your health. The millimeter wave scanners use low power radio frequency waves to create the image, The frequency is the same as that used for Wi-Fi devices. If you stood for three seconds in a scanner, it would be no more radiation exposure than standing in front of your computer router at home.

- Backscatter scanners, meanwhile, can still be found in other places like jails an courthouses. They do expose people to small amounts of X-rays, but the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) considers them safe. A person receives more radiation from naturally occurring sources in less than an hour of ordinary living than from one screening with any general-use X-ray security system,says the FDA. Yet others are not so convinced.

- The European Union prohibits the backscatters. Some scientists belive that even very low level X-ray exposure could increase the risk of cancer. "I would agree that the individual risk associated with X-ray scanners is likely to be extremely small," says David Brenner, head of Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research. "The issue of concern is when the X-ray scanners are used in a very high volume setting (just under a billion security screend occur each year in US airports). A very tiny risk multiplied by a billion has the potential to represent a pubilc health issue."

31. Air passengers were afraid that backscatter imaging would ` `.

- [A] delay their boarding
- [B] invade their privacy
- [C] do harm to their health
- [D] cause a public uproar

32. The millimeter wave screener is now applied as it ``.

- [A] reduces the health risk of scanning
- [B] shows the details of a person's body
- [C] uses a lower frequency than Wi-Fi devices
- [D] exposes people to a fixed amount of X-rays

33. The FDA believes that the health risk of backscatter scanning ``.

- [A] will be lowered
- [B] can be tolerated
- [C] must be measured
- [D] should be avoided

34. David Brenner's remarks support the idea that ``.

- [A] low level X-ray exposure may become a health concern
- [B] exposure to X-rays is a common phenomenon in our life
- [C] tiny risks may develop into big threats to traffic safely
- [D] the European Union's ban of backscatters is an overreaction

35. What is the passage mainly about?

- [A] The improvenment of airport security
- [B] The significance of full body imaging.
- [C] Uses of the millimeter wave screener.

 Read the texts from a magazine article in which five people talk about internet techonlogy. For questions 36-40, match the name of each perpon to one of statements(A~G) given below. Mark your answers on your ANSWER SHEET.

- Lucia Amour:  
  The internet is a positive influence on modern-day generations, keeping them informed on both local and global news quickly. It is the top source of news for 18- to 24-year-olds. It also helps people to form opinions from news and about others on their own. Lastly, it helps people to stay in touch with global causes that they would not be able to learn about without the use of the internet.

- David Alex:  
  The internet both helps and hurts us, allowing us access to things previously thought to be impossible, not all good, but not all bad. You can make new friends, research any topic with only a few clciks, buy almost anything and communicate with others across long distances without any effort. It can also lead to bad things like cybercrime, being unsocial, and can make people belive things that aren't true.

- Nelda Penn:  
  Internet technology has had an influence on mankind, whether it is good or bad. What we should realize is that there will always be people that feel the need to hurt others. We can't change this. However, we can learn from their actions and learn how to avoid the people who want to hurt us. We can't change the actions of those around us, but we can decide our actions.

- Grace Hand:  
  Internet technology is an amazing thing that humans are relying on too much. People are becoming so dependent that the internet is huring them in many ways. For one thing, many people don't turn to people for help but go on the internet. For another, the internet is making mankind really lazy. You can do almost everything on it except build relationships.

- Louis Perry:  
  The internet has created a world without facts for our youth. Out of touch with real life, our children are open to connecting with strangers based on mutual interests. They are willing to trust strangers based on their online profiles, unaware that many people have a faked image on the internet that glorifies the things that they are doing in life when in fact they are not doing anything significant.

57. Directions:
    Read the text below. Write an essay in about 120 words, in which you should summarize the key points of the text and make comments on them. Try to use you own words.

- A couple that has been married for 38 years--and overcame difficult circumstances--graduated from college together this month.

- On Dec. 3, their son, Charles Cole III, 33, posted a picture on the internet of his parents in their caps and gowns, which has gotten a ton of attention online.

- Cole's parents, Charles Cole Jr. and Renate, battled major financial problems when he was young, which made for a rough childhood. "I grew up pretty early," he said. "I just knew I didn't want to go through what I saw them go through."

- Cole graduated from California State University with a degree in political science and is now working towards a PhD in education. He has also worked as a social worker, developing a passion for work involving black youth and education.

- Cole's parents were inspired by him to finish college. "Our son is ambitious," recalled Charles Cole Jr. "Seeing his drive to just do it kind of pushed us."

- Cole is proud that his parents' journey was inspire by his own. "It crystalizes my work." he said. "How i grew up is part of the reason why i work really hard to fight for education for black and brown kids across this county because i know what the results are if you don't have it."

- For Cole, his parents have proven to him that you can always get back what you think you have lost, "Just because you started slow doesn'
  t mean you can't finish up strong," he said.

- 范文
  Although Cole's growing family is not strong enough, he has made great achievements in his studies and work with his own efforts and determination. His examples fully demonstrate the importance of hard work and determination in personal success.
  For one thing, if we want to achieve something, we have to strive for it. At no time should we underestimate the power of diligence. For another, determination is the most important component of success. If you are really determined to do something, however difficult it might be, you will find away of doing it at last.
  From what i say above, we can see that the main things which one needs are strong will and endeavor. A strong willed person with efforts will stand up against all odds and succeed.
