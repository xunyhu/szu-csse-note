- The extraordinary rise of living alone is the biggest social change that we've neglected to identify, let along examine.  
  独居的非凡兴起是我们忽视的最大的社会变革，更不用说审视了。

- Consider that in 1950, a mere 4 million Americans lived alone, making up only 9% of households. Back then, living alone was most common in the Westrn states that attracted seasonal workingmen, ant it was usually a short-lived stage on the road to a more conventional domestic life.  
  想想看，1950 年，只有 400 万美国人独居，仅占家庭总数的 9%。 当时，在吸引季节性工人的西方国家，独居现象最为普遍，但这通常是通往更传统家庭生活的短暂阶段。

- Not anymore. According to the latest data, nearly 33 million Americans live alone, making up 28% of households, which means they are now tied with clildless couples as the most important type, more common than the nuclear family, the multigenerational family and the roommate or group home. These aren't just temporary living situtions: over a five-year period, people who live alone are more likely to remain in their current state than anyone else except married couples with children. They're concentrated in big cities throughout the country.  
  不再。 最新数据显示，近 3300 万美国人独居，占家庭总数的 28%，这意味着他们现在以无子女夫妇为最重要的类型，比核心家庭、多代家庭和室友或团体更常见 家。 这些不仅仅是临时的居住状况：在五年的时间里，除了有孩子的已婚夫妇之外，独居的人比其他人更有可能保持目前的状态。 他们集中在全国各地的大城市。

- Living alone, being along and feeling lonely are hardly the same, yet in recent years experts have mixed them up, raising fears that the rise of living alone signals the ultimate atomization of the modern world. In fact, there's little evidence that the rise of living alone is making more Americans lonely. According to the latest studies, what matters is not whether we live alone but whether we feel alone. Divorced people often say there's nothing lonelier than living with the wrong person. Besides, people living alone compensate by becoming more socially active than those who live with others.  
  独居、相处和感到孤独几乎是不同的，但近年来专家们把它们混为一谈，引发了人们的担忧，认为独居的兴起标志着现代世界的最终原子化。 事实上，几乎没有证据表明独居现象的兴起正在让更多的美国人感到孤独。 最新研究表明，重要的不是我们是否独自生活，而是我们是否感到孤独。 离婚的人常说，没有什么比和错误的人住在一起更孤独的了。 此外，独居者会比与他人同住的人更积极参与社交活动，以此作为补偿。

- The truth is, today nearly everyone who lives alone chooses to do so, desplite less expensive options from finding roommates to living with family.  
  事实是，如今几乎每个独居者都选择这样做，尽管从寻找室友到与家人住在一起等更便宜的选择。

- After all, living alone allows us to do what we want, when we want, on our own terms. It liberates us from the restrictions of domestic partner's needs and demands. Today, in our age of digital media and ever expanding social networks, living alone can offer even greater benefits：the time and space for healing power of aloneness.  
  毕竟，独居可以让我们在自己想要的时间、按照自己的方式做自己想做的事。 它将我们从国内伴侣的需求和要求的限制中解放出来。 如今，在数字媒体和不断扩展的社交网络时代，独居可以带来更大的好处：治愈孤独的时间和空间。

- This means that living alone can help us discover who we are and what gives us meaning and purpose. It might be exactly what we need to reconnect.  
  这意味着独居可以帮助我们发现自己是谁，以及什么赋予我们意义和目的。 这可能正是我们需要重新连接的。

- If you've traveled by airplane in the pase few years, chances are you've walked through a full body scanner at the security checkpoint.
- The first generation of full body X-ray scanners rolled out in airports across the US in 2008. Known as backsatter scanners, there was a bit of an uproar from consumers when these came on the scene. Fliers feared the imagin would visually strip them of their clothers in front of the Transportation Security Administration(TSA) agents. Some health experts alse worried that these models might expose people to unnecessary radiation.

- But in 2013, the TSA replaced backscatter scanners with new-and-improved scanners, called millimeter wave screeners. They fixd the "see you naked"issue. These devices create a standard outline of a person, rather than a detailed image of the perpon's body. The're also an improvement for your health. The millimeter wave scanners use low power radio frequency waves to create the image, The frequency is the same as that used for Wi-Fi devices. If you stood for three seconds in a scanner, it would be no more radiation exposure than standing in front of your computer router at home.

- Backscatter scanners, meanwhile, can still be found in other places like jails an courthouses. They do expose people to small amounts of X-rays, but the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) considers them safe. A person receives more radiation from naturally occurring sources in less than an hour of ordinary living than from one screening with any general-use X-ray security system,says the FDA. Yet others are not so convinced.

- The European Union prohibits the backscatters. Some scientists belive that even very low level X-ray exposure could increase the risk of cancer. "I would agree that the individual risk associated with X-ray scanners is likely to be extremely small," says David Brenner, head of Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research. "The issue of concern is when the X-ray scanners are used in a very high volume setting (just under a billion security screend occur each year in US airports). A very tiny risk multiplied by a billion has the potential to represent a pubilc health issue."

## Part B

Directions:  
 Read the texts from a magazine article in which five people talk about internet techonlogy. For questions 36-40, match the name of each perpon to one of statements(A~G) given below. Mark your answers on your ANSWER SHEET.

- Lucia Amour:  
  The internet is a positive influence on modern-day generations, keeping them informed on both local and global news quickly. It is the top source of news for 18- to 24-year-olds. It also helps people to form opinions from news and about others on their own. Lastly, it helps people to stay in touch with global causes that they would not be able to learn about without the use of the internet.

- David Alex:  
  The internet both helps and hurts us, allowing us access to things previously thought to be impossible, not all good, but not all bad. You can make new friends, research any topic with only a few clciks, buy almost anything and communicate with others across long distances without any effort. It can also lead to bad things like cybercrime, being unsocial, and can make people belive things that aren't true.

- Nelda Penn:  
  Internet technology has had an influence on mankind, whether it is good or bad. What we should realize is that there will always be people that feel the need to hurt others. We can't change this. However, we can learn from their actions and learn how to avoid the people who want to hurt us. We can't change the actions of those around us, but we can decide our actions.

- Grace Hand:  
  Internet technology is an amazing thing that humans are relying on too much. People are becoming so dependent that the internet is huring them in many ways. For one thing, many people don't turn to people for help but go on the internet. For another, the internet is making mankind really lazy. You can do almost everything on it except build relationships.

- Louis Perry:  
  The internet has created a world without facts for our youth. Out of touch with real life, our children are open to connecting with strangers based on mutual interests. They are willing to trust strangers based on their online profiles, unaware that many people have a faked image on the internet that glorifies the things that they are doing in life when in fact they are not doing anything significant.
