1. W: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr.Smith.  
   M: What's up, Mary?  
   W: I'm afraid I can't work overtime tomorrow. John and I are holding a party for the 5th anniversary of our wedding.  
   M: That's all right. Enjoy yourselves.

2. W: Guess who I met at the grocery store this morning?  
   M: Well, I can't imagine.  
   W: Do you remember Mr.Johnson? He used to live in the building next to ours.  
   M: Oh, yes, now I remember. He had dark hair and wore glasses.

3. M: I've just been interviewed for a reporter's job on the evening paper.  
   W: What's your overall feeling about how it went?  
   M: Well, I think I made a good impression.  
    It seems that they were interested in me because I've worked as a reporter before.

4. W: Northwest Airways, good morning. Can I help you?  
   M: Yes, do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon?  
   W: Yes, there is a flight at 6∶45 and one at 18∶00.  
   M: That's fine. Could you tell me how much return flight costs?  
   W: That would be 418 dollars.

5. W: You look tired, John. What have you been doing?  
   M: My teacher wasn't happy with my mid-term essay. She told me to do it all over again.  
   W: At least, she gave you a second chance.

6. W: I'm worried about my son at driving, but he won't listen to me.  
   M: Well, teenagers always think they won't get hurt, but the fact is just the opposite.  
   W: What should I do?  
   M: Keep talking with him and lead by an example. Parents always matter.

7. W: Where is Jack? His manager is trying to catch him several times but has always just missed him.

   W: What's been going on?  
   M: It has been many emergency calls and he is the only technician available to go out and deal with them.

   M: Here you are.

9. W: I went to the dentist's to get my teeth polished this morning.  
   M: How terrible!  
   W: Well, the chair was so cleverly placed. I got a terrific view of Times Square down below. He finished the job before I knew it.

10. M: I hear the guy who is going to deliver the lecture this weekend spend a year living in the rainforest.  
    W: Great. I'm doing a report on the rainforest. Maybe I can get some new information to add to it.

## Part B

1. M: Your readers are interested in your childhood. What was it like?  
    你的读者对你的童年感兴趣。它是什么样子的？

   W: I grew up in a small town. We lived in very poor housing but we lived always in very beautiful settings, so I have favorite trees and I have contacted with birds.  
    我在一个小镇长大。我们住在非常贫穷的房子里，但我们总是住在非常美丽的环境中，所以我有最喜欢的树，我也接触过鸟类。

   My parents were farm workers. Though we were poor for most of part, I think I was often happy.  
    我父母都是农场工人。虽然我们大部分时间都很穷，但我想我经常很开心。

   M: It would not have been expected from that background that you'll become a literary figure. Was your mother ambitious with you?  
    在那种背景下，你不会成为一个文学人物。你母亲对你有野心吗？

   W: Well, my mother wasn't especially ambitious with me in the sense of going to college when I grew up. I think her greatest contribution was simply that she loved me very much.  
    嗯，在我长大后上大学的意义上，我母亲对我并不是特别有野心。我认为她最大的贡献就是她非常爱我。

   No matter what happened, I had my mother with me.  
    不管发生什么事，我都有妈妈陪着我。

   M: She gave you confidence.  
    她给了你信心。

   W: Oh, she did. She earned very little money, offering about $10 a week and never more than $20 a week. And in spite of that, she managed to buy a typewriter for me.  
    哦，她做到了。她挣的钱很少，每周大约 10 美元，从来没有超过 20 美元。尽管如此，她还是设法给我买了一台打字机。

   She managed to buy me my first toothpaste when I left home. She just wanted me to be able to do things that she couldn't do even she didn't know what they were.  
    我离家时，她设法给我买了第一支牙膏。她只是想让我能够做她做不到的事情，即使她不知道这些事情是什么。

2. W: Good morning. Can I help you?  
    早上好我能帮你吗？

   M: I'd like to make a complaint about my holiday in Paris last week.  
    我想投诉一下我上周在巴黎度假的事。

   W: I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly was the problem?  
    听到这个消息我很难过。到底是什么问题？

   M: First of all, the coach taking us to the hotel broke down and we had to wait for over 2 hours in the terrible heat before our replacement arrived.  
    首先，带我们去酒店的长途汽车坏了，我们不得不在酷热中等了两个多小时，我们的替代者才来。

   Then when we got to the hotel, we found our room hadn't been cleaned.  
    然后当我们到达酒店时，我们发现我们的房间还没有打扫干净。

   W: Oh, dear. Did you complain to the hotel staff?  
    哦，天哪。你向酒店工作人员投诉了吗？

   M: Of course, but we were told all the cleaners were off duty. Anyway, that's not all. The people in room above sounded like they were having all night parties every night.  
    当然，但我们被告知所有清洁工都下班了。无论如何，这还不是全部。楼上房间里的人听起来好像每晚都在开通宵派对。

   I demanded another room but the receptionist told me the hotel was full.  
    我要另一个房间，但接待员告诉我酒店已经客满了。

   W: Oh, I see.  
    哦，我明白了。

   M: And the worst thing was the food in the restaurant was awful. It was so bad we had to eat out all the time despite having paid for meals in the price of our holiday.  
    最糟糕的是餐厅里的食物太难吃了。天气太糟糕了，我们不得不一直在外面吃饭，尽管我们已经用假期的价格支付了餐费。

   W: I do apologize. I'd like to offer you a 20% discount on the price of one of our autumn breaks as a gesture of good will.  
    我真的很抱歉。为了表示善意，我想在我们的一次秋假的价格上给你打八折。

   M: A 20% discount? You must be joking. I want to see the manager.  
    八折优惠？你一定是在开玩笑。我想见经理。

    我们的调查发现，在巴西，人们对变瘦的压力最大。83%的巴西人认为过于强调体重。法国人最有可能指责美国人。

   They use American's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem. Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity. They are followed by Germans and Indians.  
    他们用美国人的快餐作为他们超重问题的借口。俄罗斯人最有可能将肥胖归咎于他们的父母。紧随其后的是德国人和印度人。

   When asked who encouraged them to try to lose weight, the Swiss tend to exclude their doctor.

   W: Stay tuned for more about the NWHA survey, we will be back soon after the break.  
    请继续关注 NWHA 调查的更多信息，我们将在休息后不久回来。

4. M: Emily, what do you do as a trendspotter?

   M: What kind of company is it?  
    这是一家什么样的公司？

# SECTION 2 Reading

(50minutes)

## PartA

### Text 1

- In 1997, 25 Japanese citizens, all older than 60, launched Jeeba (the name means "old man and old woman") to make senior-friendly products. They knew they were making history when they coined their company motto: "Of the elderly, by the elderly and for the elderly." They do not hire young people, and the oldest of their workers is 75.

- Firms run by senior citizens are still a rarity, in Japan and worldwide. But the elderly have numbers on their side. Healther and longer-living seniors, born immediately after World War II, are reaching retirement age in huge numbers all over the developed world. Extremely low birthrates in those samse countries mean there are far fewer young workers to take their place. One likely consequence is now clear: shrinking work forces.

  - far fewer 远远少于 far 远的 fewer 更少的
  - shrinking work forces shrink 收缩;缩小; force 力;力量; 强迫，迫使

- While the streamlining effects of international competition are focusing attention on the need to create and keep good jobs, those fears will eventually give way to worries about the growing shortage of young workers. One unavoidable solution: putting older people back to work, whether they like it or not. Indeed, advanced economies like those of Finland and Denmark have already raised their retirement ages. Others are under severe pressure to follow suit, as both the European Commission and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have recently warned their members that their future prosperity depends on a growing contribution from the elderly.

  - give way to 被…替代;向…让步;向…妥协
  - put putt putting
  - follow suit 跟着做;照着做;仿效

- Whether these changes are good or bad news to workers depends on whether the anticipate retirement with eagerness or dread. In the United States, half of working-age Americans now expect to work into their 70s, whether by financial necessity or by lifestyle choice, according to a new study by Putnam Investments.

- Contrary to still widespread assumptions, there is very little hard evidence to suggest that companies cannot stay competitive with a rising share of older workers. At British hardware chain B&Q, its "elder worker" stores in Manchester and Exmouth were 18 percent more profiable than its regular outlets--due in part, the company says, to six times less employee turnover and 60 percent less shoplifting and breakage.

  - share of older workers 老年工人的比例
  - six times 六次;六倍;六回

### Text 2

- One important thing during the pre-Christmas rush at our house was the arrival of my daughter's kindergarten report card. She got high praise for her reading, vocabulary and overall enthusiasm. On the other hand, we learnt that she was work to do on her numbers and facility with the computer, though the detailed handwritten report her teachers prepared is absent of any words that might be interpreted as negative in describing her efforts. A number system indicates how she's measuring up in each area without any mention of passing or failing.

  - report card 学年(或学期)成绩单;工作情况报告
  - learnt learn 的过去分词和过去式
  - measuring up 合格
  - passing or failing 通过或失败

- All of which seems to make my daughter's school neither fish nor fowl when it comes to the debate over the merits of giving formal grades to kids. At one level, the advantages and disadvantages are obvious. A grade system provides a straightforward standard by which to measure how your child is progressing at school--and how he or she is getting on compared to other children. But as writer Sue Ferguson notes, "Grades can deceive." The aim should be "to measure learning, not simply what a student can recall on a test." The two aren't the same--and if you doubt that as an adult, ask yourself whether you could sit down without any preparation and still pass those high-school-level examinations.

  - All of which 所有这些
  - neither 既不…也不…；两者都不
  - neither fish nor fowl 不伦不类 fish 鱼 fowl 家禽;鸟 nor 也没有; 也不
  - debate 争论，讨论
  - merits 优点
  - formal 正式的；正规的
  - grades 等级；评分等级；成绩等级
  - advantages and disadvantages 优点和缺点
  - obvious 明显的;显然的; observe 观察
  - straightforward 简单的;直截了当的;坦率的;易懂的;率直的;坦诚的;不复杂的
  - standard 标准，规范
  - progress 进展;进步; schedule 明细表，清单;日程安排;
  - getting on compared 进行比较
  - note 注释;记录;笔记;便条;批注;短笺;按语
  - Grades can deceive. 分数可能会骗人
  - not simply what a student can recall on a test 不仅仅是学生在考试中能回忆起什么
  - The two aren't the same 两者不一样
  - if you doubt that as an adult 如果你成年后对此表示怀疑
  - preparation 准备;(医药、化妆品等)配制品，制剂;准备工作;预备

- If you're old enough, you've lived through this debate before. At one time, it was considered unfair to put children in direct competition with one another if it could be avoided. The intention behind that may have been good, but it ignored the fact that competition, and the will to come out on top, are essential compoents of the human condition.

  - you've lived through this debate before 你以前经历过这种争论
  - At one time 一度;曾经
  - fair 公平的; fairly more fairly most fairly
  - direct 直接的;
  - intention 意图;打算;目的;计划
  - come out on top 出人头地;拔得头筹;占得上风
  - essential 基本的
  - human condition 人类状况 ; 人类条件 ;

- This time around, educators working with a no-grades approach are emphasizing different reasons. The thing is, that approach is much more commonplace in the adult workplace than is the traditional pass-fail system we place on our children. Many workplaces conduct regular employee evaluations. There are usually fairly strict limits to what an employer can tell an employee in those evaluations--and even then, negative evaluations can be challenged by the employee. No matter where you sit in the debate over the grade system, then, the real question is this: if it's so good for kids, why isn't that also true for adults?
  - This time around 这一次;此时此刻
  - educator 教师;教育工作者; educate 教育
  - approach 方法;(待人接物或思考问题的)方式;
  - emphasize 重读，强调(词或短语);强调;
  - The thing is 问题是
  - much more 更;何况
  - commonplace 老生常谈;平常的事; 普遍的;普通的;平凡的 that approach is much more commonplace 这种方法要常见得多
  - workplace 工作场所
  - the traditional pass-fail system we place on our children 我们给孩子的传统及格-不及格制度 place on 在上放置 ; 寄托
  - conduct 行为;(人在某地或某种情况下的)举止;经营方式;管理方法;实施;传导
  - regular 定时的，定期的; 常客，老主顾;经常;非常;完全; Many workplaces conduct regular employee evaluations. 许多工作场所定期对员工进行评估。
  - There are usually fairly strict limits 通常有相当严格的限制
  - employer 雇主 employee 雇员
  - even then 尽管那样
  - negative evaluations can be challenged by the employee 负面评价可能会受到员工的质疑 challenged (委婉说法)伤残的，有残疾的 对…怀疑(或质疑); change 改变；challenge 挑战;质疑;
  - No matter where you sit in the debate over the grade system 无论你在关于分数制的辩论中坐在哪里 No matter 没关系 ; 不管怎样 sit in 静坐 ; 出席 ; 照看

## Part B

- Mike:

  - Praise often and sincerely-it's an simple as that. Employees want to feel needed and appreciated. By offering sincere praise with examples about what they did right, you'll go far in creating an energetic team. Meanwhile, i don't agree with the assertion that "to focus on what needs improving isn't good management." In fact, it's the balance of praise along with constructive criticism that drives employees to work smarter and reach higher.
    - it's an simple as that 就这么简单;
    - go far 成功 ; 够用;
    - along with 随着 ; 随同…一起;

- Frank:

  - This article makes a valid point that needs to be understood, especially for the new generation of workers, my generation. We don't see ourselves as parts in the machine to be put in the dark to work. My generation needs respect in return from our employer, we need to feel appreciated beyond just a pay check, it's the difference between being fulfilled at our career and being sad at our job.
    - in return 作为回报 ;pay check 工资支票 ;

- Joyce:

  - One skill missing in today's workplace is the ability to build effective business relationships. At the core of that relationship is the need for consistent feedback. "How am I doing?" is a question that should be answered consistently. When you tell an employee once a year what is needed to improve, you have not done your job as a leader-build skills, provide feedback and help the employee grow and develop.
    - the core 核心 ; 堆芯 ; 地核;
    - need for 需要… ; 需要 ;

- Ellen:

  - I don't see a problem with praising employees when it's truly deserved (insincere praise is an entirely different story). It's a cost-free "benefit", if you will, in that it allows employees to see that their efforts are both noticed and valued. In the work world there are always people available to tell you are doing something wrong and far too few occasions when employees are told that they've done something right!
    - cost-free 免费的 ; 成本;
    - noticed and valued 关注和重视;
    - far too few occasions 太少的场合;

- Diana:
  - Praise what the employee did. Be specific about why it was helpful. An employee who continually earns your praise alse deserves your attention as to how else to reward their behavior. Meaningful praise encourages people beyond anything else. Written comments are available for later review. They give them confidence that they can "do it again." I never regretted praising an employee who deserved it but often kicked myself for missing an opportunity.

## Part C

- At 21, Ricardo Semler became boss of his father's business in Brazil, Semco, which sold parts for ships. Semler Junior worked like a madman, from 7:30 a.m. , until midnight every day. One afternoon, while touring a factory in New York, he collapsed. The doctor who treated him said, "There's nothing wrong with you. But if you continue like this, you'll find a new home in our hospital." Semler got the message. He changed the way he worked. In fact, he changed the ways his employees worked too.
- He let his workers take more responsibility so that they would be the ones worrying when things went wrong. He allowd them to set their own salaries, and he cut all the jobs he thought were unnecessary, like receptionists and secretaries.`This saved money and brought more equality to the company.` “Everyone at Semco, even top managers, meets guests in reception, does the photocopying, sends faxes, types letters and dials the phone.”
- He completely reorganized the office: instead of walls, they have plants at Semco, so bosses can't shut themselves away from everyone else. `And the workers are free to decotate their workspace as they want.` As for uniforms, some people wear suits and others wear T-shirts.
- Semler says, "We have a sales manager named Rubin Agater who sits there reading the newspaper hour after hour. He doesn't even pretend to be busy. But when a Semco pump on the other side of the world fails millions of gallons of oil are about to spill into the sea. Rubin springs into action `He knows everything there is to know about our pumps and how to fix them.` That's when he earns his salary. No one cares if he doesn't look busy the rest of the time."
- Semco has flexible working hours: the employees decide when they need to arrice at work. `Also, Semco lets its workers use the company's machines for their own projects, and makes them take holidays for at least thirty days a year`.
- It sounds perfect, but does it work? The answer is in the numbers: in the last six years, Semco's revenues have gone from $35 million to $212 million. The company has grown from eight hundred employees to 3,000. Why?
- Semler says it's because of "peer pressure". Peer pressure makes employees work hard for everyone else.`If someone isn't doing his job well, the other workers will not allow the situation to continue.` In other words, Ricardo Semler treats his workers like adults and expects them to act like adults. And they do.

## Part D

- America's Internet is faster than ever before, but people still complain about their Internet being too slow.
- New York's Attorney General's office `launched` an investigation in the fall into whether or not Verizon, Cablevision and Time Warner are delivering broadband that's as fast as the providers `claim` it is. Earlier this month, the office asked for the public's help to measure their speed results, saying consumers `deserved` to get the speeds they were promised. "Too many of us may be paying for one thing, and getting another," the Attorney General said.
- If the inverstigation uncovers anything, it wouldn't be the first time a telecom provider got into `trouble` over the broadband speeds it promised and delivered customers. Back in June, the Federal Communications Commission fined AT&T $100 million over `accusations` that the carrier secretly reduced wireless speeds after customers consumed a certain amount of `data`.
- Even when they stay on the right side of the law, Internet providers arouse customers' anger over bandwidth speed and cost. Just this week, an investigation found that media and telecom giant Comcast is the most `hated` provider. Over 10 months, Comcast received nearly 12,000 customer complaints, many `relating` to its monthly data cap and overage charges.
- Some Americans are getting so `frustrated` with Internet providers they're just giving up. A recent study found that the number of Americans with high-speed Internet at home today `actually` fell during the last two years, and 15% of people now consider themselves to be "cord-cutters".
