- In 1997, 25 Japanese citizens, all older than 60, launched Jeeba (the name means "old man and old woman") to make senior-friendly products. They knew they were making history when they coined their company motto: "Of the elderly, by the elderly and for the elderly." They do not hire young people, and the oldest of their workers is 75.

  - senior、senior-friendly junior
  - citizens citizen city cities
  - launched
  - motto
  - hire 雇用;聘用;租用;

- Firms run by senior citizens are still a rarity, in Japan and worldwide. But the elderly have numbers on their side. Healther and longer-living seniors, born immediately after World War II, are reaching retirement age in huge numbers all over the developed world. Extremely low birthrates in those samse countries mean there are far fewer young workers to take their place. One likely consequence is now clear: shrinking work forces.

  - firm company film
  - senior citizens
  - rarity
  - worldwide 在全世界;遍及全球地；世界各地的;
  - side
  - immediately immediate
  - extremely 极端
  - birthrate 出生率
  - far fewer 远远少于 far 远的 fewer 更少的
  - consequence 后果 结果
  - shrinking work forces shrink 收缩;缩小; force 力;力量; 强迫，迫使

- While the streamlining effects of international competition are focusing attention on the need to create and keep good jobs, those fears will eventually give way to worries about the growing shortage of young workers. One unavoidable solution: putting older people back to work, whether they like it or not. Indeed, advanced economies like those of Finland and Denmark have already raised their retirement ages. Others are under severe pressure to follow suit, as both the European Commission and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have recently warned their members that their future prosperity depends on a growing contribution from the elderly.

- Whether these changes are good or bad news to workers depends on whether the anticipate retirement with eagerness or dread. In the United States, half of working-age Americans now expect to work into their 70s, whether by financial necessity or by lifestyle choice, according to a new study by Putnam Investments.

- Contrary to still widespread assumptions, there is very little hard evidence to suggest that companies cannot stay competitive with a rising share of older workers. At British hardware chain B&Q, its "elder worker" stores in Manchester and Exmouth were 18 percent more profiable than its regular outlets--due in part, the company says, to six times less employee turnover and 60 percent less shoplifting and breakage.

### Text 2

- One important thing during the pre-Christmas rush at our house was the arrival of my daughter's kindergarten report card. She got high praise for her reading, vocabulary and overall enthusiasm. On the other hand, we learnt that she was work to do on her numbers and facility with the computer, though the detailed handwritten report her teachers prepared is absent of any words that might be interpreted as negative in describing her efforts. A number system indicates how she's measuring up in each area without any mention of passing or failing.

  - mention 提及;说起;
  - passing or failing 通过或失败

- All of which seems to make my daughter's school neither fish nor fowl when it comes to the debate over the merits of giving formal grades to kids. At one level, the advantages and disadvantages are obvious. A grade system provides a straightforward standard by which to measure how your child is progressing at school--and how he or she is getting on compared to other children. But as writer Sue Ferguson notes, "Grades can deceive." The aim should be "to measure learning, not simply what a student can recall on a test." The two aren't the same--and if you doubt that as an adult, ask yourself whether you could sit down without any preparation and still pass those high-school-level examinations.

  - All of which 所有这些
  - neither 既不…也不…；两者都不
  - neither fish nor fowl 不伦不类 fish 鱼 fowl 家禽;鸟 nor 也没有; 也不
  - debate 争论，讨论

  - advantages and disadvantages 优点和缺点

  - if you doubt that as an adult 如果你成年后对此表示怀疑
  - preparation 准备;(医药、化妆品等)配制品，制剂;准备工作;预备

- If you're old enough, you've lived through this debate before. At one time, it was considered unfair to put children in direct competition with one another if it could be avoided. The intention behind that may have been good, but it ignored the fact that competition, and the will to come out on top, are essential compoents of the human condition.

  - essential 基本的
  - human condition 人类状况 ; 人类条件 ;

- This time around, educators working with a no-grades approach are emphasizing different reasons. The thing is, that approach is much more commonplace in the adult workplace than is the traditional pass-fail system we place on our children. Many workplaces conduct regular employee evaluations. There are usually fairly strict limits to what an employer can tell an employee in those evaluations--and even then, negative evaluations can be challenged by the employee. No matter where you sit in the debate over the grade system, then, the real question is this: if it's so good for kids, why isn't that also true for adults?
  - This time around 这一次;此时此刻
  - educator 教师;教育工作者; educate 教育

  - There are usually fairly strict limits 通常有相当严格的限制
