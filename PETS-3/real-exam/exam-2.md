# SECTION 1 Listening

## Part A

1. W: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr.Smith.  
   M: What's up, Mary?  
   W: I'm afraid I can't work overtime tomorrow. John and I are holding a party for the 5th anniversary of our wedding.  
   M: That's all right. Enjoy yourselves.

2. W: Guess who I met at the grocery store this morning?  
   M: Well, I can't imagine.  
   W: Do you remember Mr.Johnson? He used to live in the building next to ours.  
   M: Oh, yes, now I remember. He had dark hair and wore glasses.

3. M: I've just been interviewed for a reporter's job on the evening paper.  
   W: What's your overall feeling about how it went?  
   M: Well, I think I made a good impression.  
    It seems that they were interested in me because I've worked as a reporter before.

4. W: Northwest Airways, good morning. Can I help you?  
   M: Yes, do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon?  
   W: Yes, there is a flight at 6∶45 and one at 18∶00.  
   M: That's fine. Could you tell me how much return flight costs?  
   W: That would be 418 dollars.

5. W: You look tired, John. What have you been doing?  
   M: My teacher wasn't happy with my mid-term essay. She told me to do it all over again.  
   W: At least, she gave you a second chance.

6. W: I'm worried about my son at driving, but he won't listen to me.  
   M: Well, teenagers always think they won't get hurt, but the fact is just the opposite.  
   W: What should I do?  
   M: Keep talking with him and lead by an example. Parents always matter.

7. W: Where is Jack? His manager is trying to catch him several times but has always just missed him.  
   M: That's because he is being in and out all day.  
   W: What's been going on?  
   M: It has been many emergency calls and he is the only technician available to go out and deal with them.

8. W: Can you change the bill for me please?  
   M: Sure, 5,10,15,20. OK, 20.  
   W: Can I have some coins? I need them for a phone call.  
   M: Here you are.

9. W: I went to the dentist's to get my teeth polished this morning.  
   M: How terrible!  
   W: Well, the chair was so cleverly placed. I got a terrific view of Times Square down below. He finished the job before I knew it.

10. M: I hear the guy who is going to deliver the lecture this weekend spend a year living in the rainforest.  
    W: Great. I'm doing a report on the rainforest. Maybe I can get some new information to add to it.

## Part B

1. M: Your readers are interested in your childhood. What was it like?  
   W: I grew up in a small town. We lived in very poor housing but we lived always in very beautiful settings, so I have favorite trees and I have contacted with birds.  
   My parents were farm workers. Though we were poor for most of part, I think I was often happy.  
   M: It would not have been expected from that background that you'll become a literary figure. Was your mother ambitious with you?  
   W: Well, my mother wasn't especially ambitious with me in the sense of going to college when I grew up. I think her greatest contribution was simply that she loved me very much. No matter what happened, I had my mother with me.  
   M: She gave you confidence.  
   W: Oh, she did. She earned very little money, offering about $10 a week and never more than $20 a week. And in spite of that, she managed to buy a typewriter for me. She managed to buy me my first toothpaste when I left home. She just wanted me to be able to do things that she couldn't do even she didn't know what they were.

2. W: Good morning. Can I help you?  
   M: I'd like to make a complaint about my holiday in Paris last week.  
   W: I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly was the problem?  
   M: First of all, the coach taking us to the hotel broke down and we had to wait for over 2 hours in the terrible heat before our replacement arrived. Then when we got to the hotel, we found our room hadn't been cleaned.  
   W: Oh, dear. Did you complain to the hotel staff?  
   M: Of course, but we were told all the cleaners were off duty. Anyway, that's not all. The people in room above sounded like they were having all night parties every night. I demanded another room but the receptionist told me the hotel was full.  
   W: Oh, I see.  
   M: And the worst thing was the food in the restaurant was awful. It was so bad we had to eat out all the time despite having paid for meals in the price of our holiday.  
   W: I do apologize. I'd like to offer you a 20% discount on the price of one of our autumn breaks as a gesture of good will.  
   M: A 20% discount? You must be joking. I want to see the manager.

3. W: Good evening. Welcome back to Miss Know It All. For today's program, Mr.John Smith, chairman of National Weight and Health Association, has come with findings from out recent NWHA survey on obesity.
   Now, Mr.Smith, what is the purpose of your survey?

   M: We wanted to explore how people around the world view obesity or being overweight. Actually, obesity has gone global.  
   W: How did you do it?  
   M: We interviewed 16,000 people in 16 countries.  
   W: How large is the overweight population of the world according to your estimates?  
   M: 1.6 billion including 18 million children under age 5.  
   W: Really surprising, isn't it? And what are your findings about people's attitudes regarding obesity?  
   M: Our survey found that people in Brazil feel the most pressure to be thin. 83% of Brazilians think there is too much emphasis placed on weight. French are most likely to blame Americans.  
   They use American's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem. Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity. They are followed by Germans and Indians.  
   When asked who encouraged them to try to lose weight, the Swiss tend to exclude their doctor.  
   W: Stay tuned for more about the NWHA survey, we will be back soon after the break.

4. M: Emily, what do you do as a trendspotter?  
   W: Very simple. Take digital photos of youth culture and send them to my company. It's called Look-Look.  
   M: What kind of company is it?  
   W: It's a youth culture marketing and trend forecasting firm in Hollywood. I'm one of Look-Look's 65,000 trendspotters worldwide.  
   M: Look-Look gets a lot of information about the ever-shifting tastes of the youth market by these images.  
   W: Yes, its clients are mostly companies. They get information about trends from Look-Look and develop their products.They also use the images of Look-Look on their websites to impress young people and promote their newly designed products.  
   M: But are there any people who don't like their pictures to be used on the website?  
   W: I always have my subjects' permission before I take their pictures and put up their images onto Look-Look.com.  
   M: Where do you find your best subjects?  
   W: At school, in the park, at local supermarkets and near many music clubs.  
   M: What is difficult about this job?  
   W: To catch our original styles because so many young people try hard to stand out. You have to be able to find the difference between someone who is copying trends and someone who is truly inventing a new look.  
   M: Thank you for talk with us, Emily.

# SECTION 2 Reading

(50minutes)

## PartA

### Text 1

- In 1997, 25 Japanese citizens, all older than 60, launched Jeeba (the name means "old man and old woman") to make senior-friendly products. They knew they were making history when they coined their company motto: "Of the elderly, by the elderly and for the elderly." They do not hire young people, and the oldest of their workers is 75.

- Firms run by senior citizens are still a rarity, in Japan and worldwide. But the elderly have numbers on their side. Healther and longer-living seniors, born immediately after World War II, are reaching retirement age in huge numbers all over the developed world. Extremely low birthrates in those samse countries mean there are far fewer young workers to take their place. One likely consequence is now clear: shrinking work forces.

- While the streamlining effects of international competition are focusing attention on the need to create and keep good jobs, those fears will eventually give way to worries about the growing shortage of young workers. One unavoidable solution: putting older people back to work, whether they like it or not. Indeed, advanced economies like those of Finland and Denmark have already raised their retirement ages. Others are under severe pressure to follow suit, as both the European Commission and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have recently warned their members that their future prosperity depends on a growing contribution from the elderly.

- Whether these changes are good or bad news to workers depends on whether the anticipate retirement with eagerness or dread. In the United States, half of working-age Americans now expect to work into their 70s, whether by financial necessity or by lifestyle choice, according to a new study by Putnam Investments.

- Contrary to still widespread assumptions, there is very little hard evidence to suggest that companies cannot stay competitive with a rising share of older workers. At British hardware chain B&Q, its "elder worker" stores in Manchester and Exmouth were 18 percent more profiable than its regular outlets--due in part, the company says, to six times less employee turnover and 60 percent less shoplifting and breakage.

### Text 2

- One important thing during the pre-Christmas rush at our house was the arrival of my daughter's kindergarten report card. She got high praise for her reading, vocabulary and overall enthusiasm. On the other hand, we learnt that she was work to do on her numbers and facility with the computer, though the detailed handwritten report her teachers prepared is absent of any words that might be interpreted as negative in describing her efforts. A number system indicates how she's measuring up in each area without any mention of passing or failing.

- All of which seems to make my daughter's school neither fish nor fowl when it comes to the debate over the merits of giving formal grades to kids. At one level, the advantages and disadvantages are obvious. A grade system provides a straightforward standard by which to measure how your child is progressing at school--and how he or she is getting on compared to other children. But as writer Sue Ferguson notes, "Grades can deceive." The aim should be "to measure learning, not simply what a student can recall on a test." The two aren't the same--and if you doubt that as an adult, ask yourself whether you could sit down without any preparation and still pass those high-school-level examinations.

- If you're old enough, you've lived through this debate before. At one time, it was considered unfair to put children in direct competition with one another if it could be avoided. The intention behind that may have been good, but it ignored the fact that competition, and the will to come out on top, are essential compoents of the human condition.

- This time around, educators working with a no-grades approach are emphasizing different reasons. The thing is, that approach is much more commonplace in the adult workplace than is the traditional pass-fail system we place on our children. Many workplaces conduct regular employee evaluations. There are usually fairly strict limits to what an employer can tell an employee in those evaluations--and even then, negative evaluations can be challenged by the employee. No matter where you sit in the debate over the grade system, then, the real question is this: if it's so good for kids, why isn't that also true for adults?

## Part B

- Mike:

  - Praise often and sincerely-it's an simple as that. Employees want to feel needed and appreciated. By offering sincere praise with examples about what they did right, you'll go far in creating an energetic team. Meanwhile, i don't agree with the assertion that "to focus on what needs improving isn't good management." In fact, it's the balance of praise along with constructive criticism that drives employees to work smarter and reach higher.

- Frank:

  - This article makes a valid point that needs to be understood, especially for the new generation of workers, my generation. We don't see ourselves as parts in the machine to be put in the dark to work. My generation needs respect in return from our employer, we need to feel appreciated beyond just a pay check, it's the difference between being fulfilled at our career and being sad at our job.

- Joyce:

  - One skill missing in today's workplace is the ability to build effective business relationships. At the core of that relationship is the need for consistent feedback. "How am I doing?" is a question that should be answered consistently. When you tell an employee once a year what is needed to improve, you have not done your job as a leader-build skills, provide feedback and help the employee grow and develop.

- Ellen:

  - I don't see a problem with praising employees when it's truly deserved (insincere praise is an entirely different story). It's a cost-free "benefit", if you will, in that it allows employees to see that their efforts are both noticed and valued. In the work world there are always people available to tell you are doing something wrong and far too few occasions when employees are told that they've done something right!

- Diana:
  - Praise what the employee did. Be specific about why it was helpful. An employee who continually earns your praise alse deserves your attention as to how else to reward their behavior. Meaningful praise encourages people beyond anything else. Written comments are available for later review. They give them confidence that they can "do it again." I never regretted praising an employee who deserved it but often kicked myself for missing an opportunity.

## Part C

- At 21, Ricardo Semler became boss of his father's business in Brazil, Semco, which sold parts for ships. Semler Junior worked like a madman, from 7:30 a.m. , until midnight every day. One afternoon, while touring a factory in New York, he collapsed. The doctor who treated him said, "There's nothing wrong with you. But if you continue like this, you'll find a new home in our hospital." Semler got the message. He changed the way he worked. In fact, he changed the ways his employees worked too.
- He let his workers take more responsibility so that they would be the ones worrying when things went wrong. He allowd them to set their own salaries, and he cut all the jobs he thought were unnecessary, like receptionists and secretaries.`This saved money and brought more equality to the company.` “Everyone at Semco, even top managers, meets guests in reception, does the photocopying, sends faxes, types letters and dials the phone.”
- He completely reorganized the office: instead of walls, they have plants at Semco, so bosses can't shut themselves away from everyone else. `And the workers are free to decotate their workspace as they want.` As for uniforms, some people wear suits and others wear T-shirts.
- Semler says, "We have a sales manager named Rubin Agater who sits there reading the newspaper hour after hour. He doesn't even pretend to be busy. But when a Semco pump on the other side of the world fails millions of gallons of oil are about to spill into the sea. Rubin springs into action `He knows everything there is to know about our pumps and how to fix them.` That's when he earns his salary. No one cares if he doesn't look busy the rest of the time."
- Semco has flexible working hours: the employees decide when they need to arrice at work. `Also, Semco lets its workers use the company's machines for their own projects, and makes them take holidays for at least thirty days a year`.
- It sounds perfect, but does it work? The answer is in the numbers: in the last six years, Semco's revenues have gone from $35 million to $212 million. The company has grown from eight hundred employees to 3,000. Why?
- Semler says it's because of "peer pressure". Peer pressure makes employees work hard for everyone else.`If someone isn't doing his job well, the other workers will not allow the situation to continue.` In other words, Ricardo Semler treats his workers like adults and expects them to act like adults. And they do.

## Part D

- America's Internet is faster than ever before, but people still complain about their Internet being too slow.
- New York's Attorney General's office `launched` an investigation in the fall into whether or not Verizon, Cablevision and Time Warner are delivering broadband that's as fast as the providers `claim` it is. Earlier this month, the office asked for the public's help to measure their speed results, saying consumers `deserved` to get the speeds they were promised. "Too many of us may be paying for one thing, and getting another," the Attorney General said.
- If the inverstigation uncovers anything, it wouldn't be the first time a telecom provider got into `trouble` over the broadband speeds it promised and delivered customers. Back in June, the Federal Communications Commission fined AT&T $100 million over `accusations` that the carrier secretly reduced wireless speeds after customers consumed a certain amount of `data`.
- Even when they stay on the right side of the law, Internet providers arouse customers' anger over bandwidth speed and cost. Just this week, an investigation found that media and telecom giant Comcast is the most `hated` provider. Over 10 months, Comcast received nearly 12,000 customer complaints, many `relating` to its monthly data cap and overage charges.
- Some Americans are getting so `frustrated` with Internet providers they're just giving up. A recent study found that the number of Americans with high-speed Internet at home today `actually` fell during the last two years, and 15% of people now consider themselves to be "cord-cutters".

- Internet is getting into people's life and becoming more and more popular. Experts are now working on setting up a national long-distance educations system in China to provide educational opportunities via Internet.
- In reality, the educational via Internet plan has been taking shape. Some universities have already got involved in regional long-distance education, catching the attention of many educators and computer experts worldwide. Others have just connected their campus computers for teaching and research, and provided more opportunities for learners.
- The Internet education will be developing dramatically. It's estimated that computerized longdistance teaching networks will be available by 2010 for postgraduate education, vocational programs, teachers' training and employees' training. Moreover, it will soon cover all the corners of China and eventually win the worldwide popularity.
