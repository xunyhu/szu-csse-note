New Zealand bans plastic bags for fresh produce in supermarkets
新西兰禁止超市生鲜农产品使用塑料袋

New Zealand has become the world's first country to expand its ban on plastic bags in supermarkets to thin bags, which are typically used to hold fruits or vegetables.
新西兰成为世界上第一个将超市塑料袋禁令扩大到薄袋的国家，薄袋通常用于盛放水果或蔬菜。

The move, which took effect on Saturday, is part of a wider government campaign against single-use plastics.
此举于周六生效，是政府针对一次性塑料制品更广泛行动的一部分。

更广泛的政府运动

Most shoppers already bring their own bags to stores after take-home plastic bags were banned in 2019.
自 2019 年禁止带回家的塑料袋以来，大多数购物者已经自带购物袋去商店。

In recent years, many countries have imposed a fee or ban on plastic bags.
近年来，许多国家对塑料袋征收费用或禁止使用。

"New Zealand produces too much waste, too much plastic waste," Associate Environment Minister Rachel Brooking said.
“新西兰产生了太多的垃圾，太多的塑料垃圾，”环境部副部长雷切尔·布鲁金（Rachel Brooking）说。

She added more than one billion plastic bags had been saved since the ban on thicker bags took effect in 2019.
她补充说，自 2019 年厚袋禁令生效以来，已经节省了超过 10 亿个塑料袋。

The new move is expected to prevent the usage of 150 million plastic bags per year.
新举措预计每年将减少 1.5 亿个塑料袋的使用。
