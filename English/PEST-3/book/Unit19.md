## Dialogue 1

- Doctor: Well, what's the matter with you, Mr.Walker?
- Mr.Walker: You'd better ask me what is not the matter with me, doctor. I seem to be suffering from all the illnesses imaginable: insomnia, headaches, indigestion and pains in the abdomen. To make things still worse, I've caught a cold, I've got a sore throat, and I'm constantly sneezing and coughing. To crown it all, I had an accident the other day, injured my chin, torn some limb muscles, and nearly broke my ribs. If i take a long walk, I get short of breath. In fact, I feel more dead than alive.
- Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that, Anyhow, I hope things aren't as bad as you imagine. Let me examine you. Your heart, chest and lungs seem to be all right. Now open your mouth and show me your tongue. Now breathe in deeply through the nose...There dosen't seem to be anything radically wrong with you, but it's quite clear that you're run down, and if you don't take care of yourself, you may have a nervous breakdown and have to go to hospital. I advise you, first of all, to relive your strained nerves. Take a long rest, have regular meals, keep to a diet of salads and fruit, and very little meat. For the sake of your health, keep off alcohol. If possible, give up smoking, at least for a time. Have this tonic made up and take two tablespoonfuls three times a day before meals. Take half this sleeping tablet before you go to bed, but not longer than one week. If you do this, I can promise you full recovery within two or three months.

- 医生：那么，沃克先生，您怎么了？
- 沃克先生：医生，您最好问我什么没问题。我似乎患上了所有能想象到的疾病：失眠、头痛、消化不良和腹部疼痛。更糟糕的是，我感冒了，喉咙痛，而且不停地打喷嚏和咳嗽。最糟糕的是，前几天我出了事故，伤了下巴，扯到了几块肌肉，几乎折断了肋骨。如果我走得太久，就会气喘吁吁。实际上，我觉得自己快死了。
- 医生：听到这些我很遗憾。不过，我希望情况没有您想象的那么糟。让我检查一下。您的心脏、胸部和肺部看起来都没问题。现在张开嘴，让我看看您的舌头。现在通过鼻子深吸一口气……看来您没有什么严重的问题，但很明显您已经精疲力竭了，如果您不照顾好自己，可能会有神经衰弱的风险，需要住院治疗。我建议您，首先，要放松紧张的神经。好好休息，按时吃饭，坚持吃沙拉和水果，少吃肉。为了您的健康，远离酒精。如果可能的话，尽量戒烟，至少暂时戒烟。把这剂补品配好，每天饭前服用两汤匙。睡前服用半片安眠药，但不要超过一周。如果您照做，我可以保证您在两到三个月内完全康复。

## Dialogue 2

Nancy's husband is suffering from high blood pressure and she is now consulting Doctor Quinn about the disease.

- Nancy: Doctor Quinn, recently my husband had a physical examination, and his doctor said that his blood pressure was high. My husband was not surprised, because his father had high blood pressure, too. Now, can you tell me what causes high blood pressure?
- Dr. Quinn: Well, doctors don't always know what causes high blood pressure, also called hypertension. But we do know a few things about this disease. For example, more men than women have it, and it usualy begins in middle or old age, and it sometimes runs in families. Many people have high blood pressure without knowing it, because there are usually no obvious symptoms. If you want to know if you have high blood pressure, ask your doctor to check it with a blood pressure machine. 病症状 mochine 器
- Nancy: Oh, I see. Now, can you tel me what should my husband do about it?
- Dr. Quinn: Is your husband heavy?
- Nancy: Yes, around 200.
- Dr. Quinn: Oh. He'd better try to control his weight. Losing weight sometimes helps. Some people's blood pressure goes down when they give up salt. Other people can improve by learning to relax and by getting the right kind of exercise. Fortunately, it is possible to control high blood pressure today with proper medicine, High blood pressure can lead to serious problems, like heart disease, so it is very important to control it.

南希的丈夫患有高血压，她现在正在咨询奎因医生关于这种疾病的问题。

- 南希：奎因医生，最近我丈夫进行了体检，他的医生说他的血压很高。我丈夫并不感到惊讶，因为他的父亲也有高血压。现在，您能告诉我是什么原因导致高血压吗？
- 奎因医生：嗯，医生并不总是知道是什么导致了高血压，也叫高血压病。但是我们对这种疾病确实了解一些情况。例如，男性患高血压的比例比女性高，而且它通常在中年或老年开始，有时会在家族中遗传。许多人在不知道的情况下就患有高血压，因为通常没有明显的症状。如果您想知道自己是否患有高血压，请让医生用血压计检查一下。
- 南希：哦，我明白了。现在，您能告诉我我丈夫应该怎么做吗？
- 奎因医生：您丈夫超重吗？
- 南希：是的，大约 200 磅。
- 奎因医生：哦。他最好试着控制体重。减肥有时有助于降低血压。有些人的血压在戒盐后会下降。其他人通过学习放松和进行适当的锻炼也能改善病情。幸运的是，今天可以通过适当的药物来控制高血压。高血压会导致严重的问题，比如心脏病，所以控制它非常重要。

## Dialogue 3

Dr. Richard Morimoto, a famous researcher in the American Medical Association, is talking about changes in medical care in the U.S.A.

Medical care has changed greatly since the days of the family doctor, who treated all family members for every type of medical problem. Today's physician is usually a specialist who treats only problems within his or her specialty.

Today's specialists often work together in a large group in order to share costs. The group will buy expensive equipment for its own offices rather than rely on hospital facilities. The office usually has a laboratory where a variety of medical tests can be performed. So, unlike physicians of the past, who often visited patients at home, today's doctors normally see patients in their offices, where they can use specialized equipment to make a more accurate diagnosis.

Likewise, many changes are taking place in hospitals, where the cost of medical equipment and care is skyrocketing. Because of the high costs, patients now spend a limited number of days in the hospital, depending on their illness. Even new mothers, who used to have a five-to-ten day hospital stay after the birth of their babies, are now being sent home in twenty-four hours.

Medical technology certainly has led to great advances in the diagnoses and cure of many illnesses. Sometimes, however, people long for the good old days when the family physician was also a family friend.

理查德·森本医生，美国医学会的一位著名研究员，正在谈论美国医疗护理的变化。

自从家庭医生为每位家庭成员治疗各种医疗问题的日子以来，医疗护理已经发生了很大的变化。今天的医生通常是专科医生，只治疗自己专业范围内的问题。

今天的专科医生经常在一个大团体中一起工作，以分担成本。团体会为自己的办公室购买昂贵的设备，而不是依赖医院设施。办公室通常有一个实验室，可以进行各种医疗测试。因此，与过去经常上门出诊的医生不同，今天的医生通常在他们的办公室接诊病人，在那里他们可以使用专业设备进行更准确的诊断。

同样，医院也在发生许多变化，医疗设备和护理的费用飞涨。由于高昂的费用，病人现在根据自己的病情在医院的住院时间有限。即使是新妈妈们，以前在生完孩子后要住院五到十天，现在也只需二十四小时就被送回家了。

医疗技术无疑在许多疾病的诊断和治疗方面取得了巨大进步。然而，有时人们会怀念那些家庭医生也是家庭朋友的美好时光。

## Dialogue 4

Hob is talking about his visit to a dentist. The following is what happened to him

I had had toothache for several days, but just hadn't much courage to go to the dentist. As a matter of fact I went twice, but just as I got on his doorstep and was going to ring the bell, the toothache seemed to have gone away, so I went home again. But at last I had to go back, and this time I rang the bell and was shown into the consulting-room.

The doctor told me to sit in a chair that he could move up and down, backwards and forwards, and then he had a look at the inside of my mouth. He put a little mirror ona long handle inside my mouth and poked about for a while, then he looked serious and said, "Yes, I'm afraid we can't save that one. It wil have to come out. It won't be necessary to give you gas for that. I'll just give you an injection."

So he filled a syringe with a liquid. I felt a little prick on the gum and that was all. He did this in two or three places and waited for a minute or so. My mouth felt rather dead, but otherwise it was all right. Then he took an instrument, got hold of my tooth, gave a twist (I could see and hear what he did, but I couldn't feel anything), then a quick pull, and the tooth was out and he was saying, "Yes, it's all over. Spit in there and then wash your mouth out with this." And he handed me a glass. "There's the tooth, a very bad one."

He was just going to throw it away, but I said, "May I have that tooth, please?"
"You can certainly have it if you want it," he said.
"Well", I replied, “it has worried me a good deal for the last week, and so now I am going to put it on my dressing-table and watch it ache."

霍布正在谈论他看牙医的经历。以下是他遇到的情况。

我牙疼了好几天，但就是没勇气去看牙医。事实上，我去了两次，但每次到了牙医的门口，正准备按门铃时，牙疼似乎都消失了，所以我又回家了。但最后我不得不回去，这次我按了门铃，被带进了诊疗室。

医生让我坐在一把可以上下、前后移动的椅子上，然后他检查了我的嘴巴。他把一面装在长柄上的小镜子放进我的嘴里，检查了一会儿，然后他看起来很严肃地说：“是的，我恐怕我们不能保住这颗牙了。它必须拔掉。不需要给你麻醉气体。我只给你打针。”

于是他把液体抽进注射器。我感到牙龈上一阵刺痛，仅此而已。他在两三处地方注射了一下，等了一两分钟。我的嘴巴感觉有点麻木，但除此之外一切正常。然后他拿起一个工具，抓住我的牙齿，扭了一下（我能看到和听到他在做什么，但我感觉不到疼痛），然后猛地一拉，牙齿就拔出来了，他说：“是的，结束了。吐在这里，然后用这个漱口。”他递给我一个玻璃杯。“这就是那颗牙齿，非常糟糕的一颗。”

他正准备扔掉它，但我说：“请问我可以要这颗牙吗？”
“如果你想要，当然可以，”他说。
“嗯，”我回答，“它在过去的一周里让我非常烦恼，所以现在我要把它放在我的梳妆台上，看着它疼。”

## Passage

For all its flaws, medical care in the United States has been reformed gigantically over the past several decades. Deaths from heart disease have fallen by 40 percent since 1970. Thanks to better detection and treatment, cancer mortality rates have been falling since 1990. Altogether, medical advances have helped to raise U.S. life expectancy from an average of 68 years in 1950 to 77 years today.

Not only have American lives grown longer, but their quality has improved. The proportion of people over 65 with one or more chronic disabilities - such as the inability to walk, or to get dressed, without aid - declined from greater than 25 percent in 1982 to less than 20 percent in 1999. And the development of vision-correction surgery, among many other drugs and procedures, has allowed many Americans to prolong pleasures historically associated with youth.

Of course, not all the recent improvements in American health and longevity can be directly attributed to our health-care system; some are as much the result of adopting healthier habits (exercise, better diet) or of dropping unhealthy ones (smoking, too much alcohol-drinking). Stil, better medical care is the principal cause of improvements in American health and life span over the past 60 years.

But the problem is that since 1960 health-care spending has grown significantly faster than the economy, meaning that we're spending an ever larger portion of our incomes on medical care. In 1960 health care constituted 5.1 percent of the U.S. economy; in 1980 it constituted 8.8 percent; today it constitutes 13.3 percent. Meanwhile, private health-insurance premiums - which rose by 14 percent last year alone — are becoming unaffordable for ever more Americans. The number of things we can do to preserve health is expanding faster than the ability of Americans to pay for them. 41 millions of our citizens are now uninsured. So the key question is not whether health care should be rationed in the United States; it already is. Rather, the question is how health care should be rationed. How should the potential benefits of reduced pain, improved quality of life, or extended life be weighted against the high costs of the medications or procedures involved? And who should weigh them? These are hard questions with high moral stakes. But we do hope that the health-care system will cover more people.

尽管存在各种缺陷，美国的医疗保健在过去几十年中已经进行了巨大的改革。自 1970 年以来，心脏病的死亡率下降了 40%。由于更好的检测和治疗，自 1990 年以来，癌症死亡率也在下降。总体来说，医疗进步帮助美国人的平均寿命从 1950 年的 68 岁提高到今天的 77 岁。

不仅美国人的寿命延长了，他们的生活质量也得到了改善。65 岁以上有一种或多种慢性残疾（如不能在没有帮助的情况下行走或穿衣）的人群比例从 1982 年的超过 25%下降到 1999 年的不到 20%。视力矫正手术的发展，以及许多其他药物和手术，允许许多美国人延长那些历史上与青春期相关的乐趣。

当然，美国健康和寿命的最近改善并不完全归功于我们的医疗保健系统；其中一些同样是由于采用了更健康的习惯（锻炼、饮食更好）或放弃了不健康的习惯（吸烟、过度饮酒）。尽管如此，过去 60 年来美国健康和寿命改善的主要原因还是更好的医疗保健。

但问题是，自 1960 年以来，医疗保健支出的增长速度显著快于经济增长速度，这意味着我们在医疗保健上的花费占收入的比例越来越大。1960 年，医疗保健占美国经济的 5.1%；1980 年，占 8.8%；而今天则占 13.3%。同时，私人医疗保险的保费（仅去年就上涨了 14%）正变得越来越多的美国人无法承受。我们能用来维护健康的手段的数量增长速度超过了美国人支付这些手段的能力。现在有 4100 万公民没有保险。因此，关键问题不是是否应该在美国实行医疗保健定量供应；它已经在实行。相反，问题是应该如何定量供应医疗保健。如何权衡减轻疼痛、改善生活质量或延长寿命的潜在好处与相关药物或手术的高成本？谁来进行这些权衡？这些是具有高度道德意义的难题。但我们确实希望医疗保健系统能覆盖更多的人。

## Use of English

In the last fifty years, modern medical research has made a number of important `advances` in heart surgery. For example, in 1954, Henry Swan, an American, established cryosurgery -- surgery in which the tissue to be cut up is frozen -- as a `standard` procedure. In that landmark operation, Swan `lowered` the patient's body temperature and `slowed down` the patient's circulation. This `allowed` the surgeon to perform the operation `in`. a dry area. This technique was successful ever since. `Another` major advance was the development of open heart surgery. C. Walter Lillehie first accomplished this in 1954. `Although` open heart surgery is still a `dangerous` operation, recently surgeons perform it. `with` greater and greater success. A discovery that `contributed` to the success of heart surgery was the `use` in 1963 of an artificial heart to circulate blood during the operation. This gave the patient `greater` safety and the doctor, Michael De Baker, more working time. `Perhaps` the most famous and most promising `action` in heart surgery was made in 1967 by Christian Barnard, a South African. He attempted to `transplant` a healthy human heart into a person who had a `defective` heart. Although the patient onlyu lived for a short while after the operation, Barnard `continued` his transplants in other patients `because` he hoped to perfect the transplanting operation. We all hope that this important advance in heart surgery can be `perfected` in the future.
