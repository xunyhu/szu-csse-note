### Activity 4 6 Minute Grammar: Question forms

## [Session 3 Be a journalist](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-1/session-3)

Language in Action: Practise question forms by preparing to interview Keith Wallace, a BBC travel journalist. You'll write some questions for an interview with him and then you'll hear his answers.

Session Grammar
In English, there are two basic types of question.

1. Yes/no questions often begin with the verb to be, but can also begin with other auxiliary verbs, such as do.

We ask these when we want a yes or no answer.

2. Wh-questions start with a question word, such as who, what, where, when, why or how.

We ask this type of question when we want different kinds of information. These questions cannot be answered with a yes or no.

### Activity 1 Writing interview questions

A dream job!

Keith Wallace is a BBC journalist who works on The Travel Show. He visits lots of interesting places all over the world. For some people it probably sounds like Keith has got 'a dream job'.
