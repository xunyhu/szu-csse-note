This is the first unit of our lower-intermediate course - so we'll go easy on you. Over the next few sessions, you'll meet some of our presenters, learn some informal ways of saying 'hello' and practise question forms. In session 5, you can join our new 10-part drama, 'The Race'. Afterwards, you can see how much you remember from the unit with our Weekly Quiz.
