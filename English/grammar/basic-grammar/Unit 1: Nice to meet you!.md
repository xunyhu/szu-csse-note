## Session 1 Saying hello

This is the first unit of our lower-intermediate course - so we'll go easy on you. Over the next few sessions, you'll meet some of our presenters, learn some informal ways of saying 'hello' and practise question forms. In session 5, you can join our new 10-part drama, 'The Race'. Afterwards, you can see how much you remember from the unit with our Weekly Quiz.

#### Find out more about the course

The new course has 30 units. Each unit has 5 sessions and each session has a number of activities, like the video and quiz you just tried. There is one session a day, every day from Monday to Friday.

In this first unit we will help you learn about some of the features you can find in the course and we'll also review the grammar of questions.

Now it's time to find out about one of our regular weekly features, 6 Minute Vocabulary.
