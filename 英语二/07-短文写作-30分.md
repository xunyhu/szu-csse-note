    范文:  

    While the reasons for travelling are many, we must not forget that it can be are freshing experience. Travelling is an experience that can teach us so many things that you cannot possibly learn while living at home.  
    Firstly, it teaches you how to make new friends. The world is full of people who love interacting. You get to make friends when you travel to new places and spend happy hours with them. Moreover, it also helps you enhance your social skills. Travelling is great for learning new skills.
    Travelling also helps us understand people. After you spend time in a new place, you can interact with the local people of the place. You learn so much about them and their culture. It makes you more open-minded and be mindful of the culture and beliefs of different people. All in all, travelling can be a fun and a great learning experience for everyone.

    Why I Love Travelling  
    Summer holiday is around the corner, and for many of us, travelling is an exciting option. I am truly fond of travelling, mainly for the following two reasons.  
    Firstly, travelling broadens my horizons. When I visit different places, I am exposed to diverse cultures, traditions, and ways of life. For instance, during my trip to Japan, I was fascinated by the unique blend of ancient and modern cultures, from the serene temples to the bustling streets of Tokyo. Secondly, it enriches my life experiences. Meeting new people, trying exotic foods, and exploring unfamiliar landscapes create memories that last a lifetime. A solo trip to the mountains once taught me the value of independence and resilience.  
    In conclusion, travelling is more than just moving from one place to another; it is a journey of self - discovery and growth. I am looking forward to my next adventure during the coming summer holiday.
