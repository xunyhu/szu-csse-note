   While the reasons for travelling are many, we must not forget that it can be are freshing experience. Travelling is an experience that can teach us so many things that you cannot possibly learn while living at home. Firstly, it teaches you how to make new friends. The world is full of people who love interacting. You get to make friends when you travel to new places and spend happy hours with them. Moreover, it also helps you enhance your social skills. Travelling is great for learning new skills.

   Travelling also helps us understand people. After you spend time in a new place, you can interact with the local people of the place. You learn so much about them and their culture. It makes you more open-minded and be mindful of the culture and beliefs of different people. All in all, travelling can be a fun and a great learning experience for everyone.

   Dear Tom,

   I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to share some exciting news with you. I recently found a job that I'm really happy about and wanted to tell you all about it.
   
   I like to be a teacher. Three reasons have led me to choose this job. First, teaching is learning. To make my lectures more helpful and interesting, I have to read more books, learn new knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world, which is the very thing I enjoy in my life. Second, teaching means freedom and independence. As a teacher, I'm free to use my own ideas and make my own decisions. Finally, I like teaching because it offers certain peace of mind.

   All in all, the reasons above make me like teaching best.

   Anyway, I just wanted to share my good news with you. Hope you're doing well!
                                                                                                                     Yours
                                                                                                                     Li Ke

   My Dream Trip

   I love travelling，because travelling broadens my horizons. I want to go to Beijing the most. There are many beautiful scenery and delicious food.

   Beijing is an ancient city and a tourist attraction. The Great Wall is one of the world's cultural heritages, which is the crystallization of the wisdom of our ancient laboring people. It is often said that if one has never climbed the Great Wall in Beijing, it means that he has never been to Beijing. There are many famous places in Beijing, such as the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace.

   Beijing was also a paradise for delicious food. Peking Duck is a famous Beijing dish that must be tried. It looks attractive and it's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

   Dear John,

   In your last email, you said that you wanted to learn Chinese. I was very surprised when I heard that and I support your decision. Now, I am writing to give you some advice.

   I think the best way is to communicate with others. So you should go to public places to listen and talk with some Chinese. In addition, you can listen to the radio or watch television to practise listening. What's more, you can read some simple Chinese newspapers, books or magazines. In the end, listening to Chinese songs is also a good way.

   I think as long as you have a strong will, you are sure to achieve your goal.
   
   Best Regards,
   Li Ke

   Spring is coming. What a nice season! The weather is getting warmer and warmer. The flowers are coming out. How beautiful the world is! Look around, the sky is blue and the leaves on the trees are turning green. The sun is shining brightly and the air is so fresh, now everyone takes off his warm coat and is more active than before.

   范文一：
   Recently the topic of green travel has been widely debated which has aroused public attention. Undoubtedly, green travel has a profound impact on both environment and social, for its significance cannot be denied.
   What is Green travel? It is a big question and it may reach out to different dimensions of environmental problems. Briefly, green travel means producing less pollution while you are on your way. The green ways of travelling includes walking, bicycling, public transportation, etc. For me, I will choose public transportation. On one hand, public transport helps to reduce transport emissions, which means less air pollution and smog. On the other hand, public transport also alleviate traffic jam and thus speed up the pace of life.
   Let’s do our bits of efforts to improve the life we live!

   范文二：
   When it comes to green transportation, everyone has his or her idea. Some people suggest that green transportation means using public transportation instead of private cars, while others think we can take more eco-friendly methods of green transportation such as walking, running and bicycling in daily life. From my point of view, I prefer the second one, especially walking to work.
   There are mainly two reasons for my view. On the one hand, walking can help me keep fit. For example, it not only exercises my body, but also makes me refreshed after working. On the other hand, it is also a good way to save money effectively, which is significant to the improvement of my current life quality.
   In a word, I fancy walking as a way of green transportation and benefit a lot from it.
