- Passwords are everywhere in computer security. All too often, they are also ineffective. A good password has to be both easy to remeber ans hard to guess, but in practice people seem to pay attention to the former. Names of wives, husbands and children are popular. "123456" or "12345" are also common choices.
- That predictability lets security researchers (and hackers) create dictionaries which list common passwords, useful to those seeking to break in. But although researchers know that passwords are insecure, working out just how insecure has been difficult. Many studies have only small samples to work on.
- However, with the co-operation of Yahoo!, Joseph Bonneau of Cambridge University obtained the biggest sample to date——70 million passwords that came with useful data about their owners.
- Mr Bonneau found some interesting variations. Older uses had better passwords than young ones. People whose preferred language was Korean or Gernam chose the most secure passwords; those who spoke Indonesian the least. Passwords designed to hide sensitive information such as credit-card numbers were only sligthly more secure than those protecting less important things, like access to games. "Nag screens" that told users they had chosen a weak password made virtually no difference. And users whose accounts had been hacked in the past did not make more secure choices than those who had never been hacked.
- But it is the broader analysis of the sample that is of most interest to security researchers. For, despite their differences, the 70 million users were still predictable enough that a generic password dictionary was effective against both the entire sample and any slice of it. Mr Bonneau is blunt: "An attacker who can manage ten guesses per account will compromise around 1% of accounts." And that is a worthwhile outcome for a hacker.
- One obvious solution would be for sites to limit the number of guesses that can be made before access is blocked. Yet whereas the biggest sites, such as Google and Microsoft, do take such measures, many do not. The reasons of their not doing so are various. So it's time for users to consider the alternatives to traditional passwords.

- John Lubock, a British member of the Parliament, led to the first law to `safeguard` Britain's `heritage`--the Ancient Monuments Bill. How did it happen?
- By the late 1800s more and more people were visiting Stonehenge for a day out. Now a World Heritage Site owned by the `Crown`, it was, at the time, `privately` owned and `neglected`.
- But the visitors `left behind` rubbish and `leftover` food. It `encouraged` rats that made holes at the stones' `foundations`, `weakening` them. One of the `upright` stones had already fallen over and one had broken in two. They also `chipped` `pieces` off the stones for `souvenirs` and `carved` pictures into them, says `architectural` `critic` Jonathan Glancey.
- It was the same for other pre-historic `remains`, which were `disappearing` fast. `Threats` also included farmers and landowners as the ancient stones got in the way of working on the fields and were a free source of building `materials`.
  -Shocked and angry, Lubbock took up the fight. When he heard Britain's largest ancient stone circle at Avebury in Wiltshire was up for sale in 1871 he `persuaded` its owners to sell it to him and the stone circle was saved.
- "Lubbock aroused national attention for ancient monuments," says Glancey. "At the time places like Stonehenge were just seen as a collection of stones, ancient sites to get building materials."
- "Lubbock knew they were the roots of British identity. He did for heritage what Darwin did for natural history."
- But Lubbock couldn't buy every threatened site. He knew laws were needed and tabled the Ancient Monuments Bill. It proposed government powers to take any pre-historic site under threat away from uncaring owners, a radical idea at the time.
- For eight years he tried and failed to get the bill through parliment. Finally, in 1882, it was voted into law. It had, however, been watered down; people had to willingly give their ancient monuments to the government. But what it did do was plant the idea that the state could preserve Britain's heritage better than private owners.
- Pressure started to be put on the owners of sites like Stonehenge to take better care of them.
