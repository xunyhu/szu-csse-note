# [Asking questions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-1/tab/grammar)

## Meaning and Use

In English, there are two basic types of question.

1. **Yes/no questions** often begin with the verb **to be**, but can also begin with other **auxiliary verbs**, such as **do**. We ask these when we want a `yes` or `no` answer. (auxiliary verb 助动词)

   _Dave: **Are** you hungry?_  
   _Mike: **Yes**, I’m starving._

   _Sarah: Did you get here on time?_  
   _Emily: No, I missed the bus!_

2. **Wh-questions** start with a question word, such as **who, what, where, when, why or how**. We ask this type of question when we want different kinds of information. These questions cannot be answered with a yes or no.

   _Dave: Why are you so hungry?_  
   _Mike: I didn’t eat breakfast._

   _Sarah: When did you get here?_  
   _Emily: About half an hour ago._
