Jean: Waiter!

Jean: No. Listen, I hate to complain, but the service here is terrible! Look,I have a ticket for the circus tonight. I'm in a hurry, but my meal took at least one hour to come. I was just kept waiting and waiting and no one told me what had happened to my order.  
Jean：没有。听着，我不想抱怨，但是这里的服务太糟糕了！看，我有一张今晚马戏团的票。我很着急，但我的餐点至少要一个小时才送来。我一直在等，没有人告诉我我的订单出了什么问题。

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Listen to a passage about a new type of restaurant that has emerged in Hong Kong.  
听一段有关香港出现的一种新型餐厅的文章。

To find Hong Kong's hottest restaurants, don't bother checking the phone book or going to the city's entertainment districts. These days, the most sought-after tables are hidden away, several floors above ground, in the city's narrow high-rise apartments, which are run by chefs out of their own homes or from rented spaces.  
要想找到香港最火爆的餐厅，不必费心查阅电话簿或前往这座城市的娱乐区。如今，最受欢迎的餐桌都隐藏在地上几层楼高的狭窄高层公寓里，这些公寓由厨师在自己的家中或租用的空间里经营。

With limited seating and irregular working hours, some of these private dining rooms are so popular that they are booked weeks or even months in advance. And because most are unlicensed and don't advertise, merely requesting a reservation can be as difficult as getting one.  
由于座位有限，营业时间不固定，一些私人包厢非常受欢迎，提前几周甚至几个月就被预订一空。而且由于大多数包厢没有营业执照，也不做广告，光是提出预订请求就和获得预订一样困难。

For chefs, the trend is mostly about staying employed. Many launched their businesses after losing their main sources of incomes. Exclusivity is the main attraction for customers in a city that is still obsessed with status, if not showiness. There's the added charm of discovering a hidden treasure that only your inner circle knows about.  
对于厨师来说，这种趋势主要是为了保住工作。许多人在失去主要收入来源后创办了自己的企业。在一个仍然痴迷于地位而非炫耀的城市里，独家经营是吸引顾客的主要因素。此外，发现只有你的密友知道的隐藏宝藏也是一种额外的魅力。

From the owner's point of view, such tiny restaurants make good business sense. In the current climate, they can afford to hire well-trained waiters from top hotels and clubs. The fixed menu also means that chefs buy only what they need for the night.  
从老板的角度来看，这种小餐馆具有良好的商业意义。在目前的环境下，他们有能力从顶级酒店和俱乐部聘请训练有素的服务员。固定菜单还意味着厨师只购买当晚所需的食物。

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Marion and her roommate Joyce are in the kitchen, because Marion's fiance and his parents are coming for lunch.  
玛丽安和她的室友乔伊斯在厨房里，因为玛丽安的未婚夫和他的父母要来吃午饭。

Joyce: Look, Marion, I have some free time this morning. Can I be of any help?  
乔伊斯：瞧，马里恩，我今天早上有空。我能帮上什么忙吗？

Marion: Oh, thank you, Joyce! You can be a great help.  
马里恩：哦，谢谢你，乔伊斯！你帮了我大忙。

Joyce: Good! What would you like me to do?  
乔伊斯：很好！你想让我做什么？

Marion: Well, I can't make up my mind about what to have for dessert. I made two apple pies last night, but I tasted one of them this morning and it didn't taste good at all.  
马里恩：嗯，我还不知道该吃什么甜点。昨晚我做了两个苹果派，今天早上我尝了一个，味道一点也不好。

Joyce: Let me try it.. Ugh! Marion, you forgot to put sugar in the apple filling!  
乔伊斯：让我试试。呃！玛丽安，你忘了在苹果馅里放糖了！

Marion: Oh no! Will I have to make the pies over again, too?  
马里恩：哦不！难道我还得重新做馅饼吗？

Joyce: You'd better if you don't want Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins making faces over their dessert.  
乔伊斯：如果你不想让詹金斯先生和詹金斯夫人因为甜点而扮鬼脸，你最好这样做。

Marion: Oh, they wouldn't do that. They're too polite. They would just make as if nothing was wrong and then complain to Steve about it later.  
马里恩：哦，他们不会这么做的。他们太客气了。他们只会假装什么事都没有发生，然后事后再向史蒂夫抱怨。

Joyce: Look, why don't you just offer some fresh fruit and cheese for dessert? Many people are more aware of proper nutrition nowadays. Steve's parents would probably like a healthy dessert.  
乔伊斯：你看，你为什么不提供一些新鲜的水果和奶酪作为甜点呢？现在很多人更注重营养。史蒂夫的父母可能喜欢健康的甜点。

Marion: What a good idea! I've got plenty of fruit in my fruit bowl and cheese in the refrigerator. Thank you so much, Joyce! You see, I was right. You are a great help, indeed!  
马里恩：真是个好主意！我的水果盘里有很多水果，冰箱里有很多奶酪。非常感谢，乔伊斯！你看，我是对的。你确实帮了大忙！

## Passage

The ladies were puzzled. Cheryl Spangler, ValeriaBorunda-Jameson and Susan Puckett, three university-admissions workers on a training visit to Florence, Kentucky,had walked into a local barbecue joint called Chung Kiwha.Butinstead of sauce-covered mutton served up from the kitchen, they saw a buffetof uncooked meats and vegetables. Instead of knives and forks, they were givenlarge scissors, chopsticks and metal tongs. No candle flickered at their table,but a bucket of fiery wood charcoal hissed in the tabletop grill pit. ChungKiwha served barbecue, all right - cook-it-yourself Korean barbecue. "I didn'trealize there were restaurants like this," marveled Spangler to her friends, whohail from Knoxville, Tennessee, "and I worked in restaurants for 20 years."

The secret is out, thanks to the growing popularity of restaurants wherethe customer is the chef. Long a staple of immigrant communities in bigcities, restaurants where diners chop, grill, boil or dip their food are hot inthe American heartland. St. Paul, Minnesota, has Thai hot-pot cooking.Indianapolis, Indiana, has Japanese shabu-shabu (another type of hot pot). Apizzeria in Las Vegas lets customers roll the dough.

Why would people bother going out to cook their own meal? "Americanswant control," says Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of research for theNational Restaurant Association. "The cook-it-yourself experience embodiesthe American values of freedom of choice and independence." With familiesspending 46% of their food budget on meals outside the home, they missthe cooking experience- sort of. "Psychologically, people want to be a littleinvolved," says Pamela Parseghian, executive food editor at Nation's RestaurantNews.

Not every diner, however, embraces the experience. Dragged in byenthusiastic wives, "men often sit with their arms crossed.. that is, until wefill them up with good wine," says Will Layfield, owner of the Melting Potin Westwood, New Jersey. At the Vinoklet, diner Greg Schafer says, "I don'tcook at home, and if I'm going to pay good money, I want someone to dothe cooking for me." What's more, do-it-yourself dining isn't cheap. At theMinturn Country Club in Minturn, Colorado, Kobe beef costs $49.95-uncooked. Still, restaurant-owners insist that the customer knows best. "Whoknows what to them is rare?" says Mikulic, owner of Vinoklet. “This way, if they screw it up, I get no complanits." Back at Chung Kiwha in Florence, diner Puckett sees it this way: "We don't have to clean up, do we?"
