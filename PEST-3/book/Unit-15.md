# Holiday Activities

## Dialogue/Monologue 1

The two speakers are talking about how to arrange travels for holidays.
W: What do you think of package holidays?
M: Well, they're usually very cheap, but joining a crowd of noisy people and eating plastic food is not my idea of a holiday.
W: Are the resorts worth visiting?
M: Some of them are, but in my experience it's better to arrange private accommodation rather than accepting the tour operator's choice of hotel.
W: But surely, you can see what you're getting in the holiday brochure.
M: You may see a picture of the hotel and there may even be a popular beach, but if you want to go to a nicer locality, you can spend all day getting there.
W: Then how do you go about making your own arrangements?
M: It's not as difficult as you think. First, you look at the â€œflight only" advertisements on teletext, in Sunday newspapers or travel shop windows to get an idea of the best time to go. I usually go in early June or mid September to avoid school children. There's a good range of flights and prices aren't too high.
W: How do you find private accommodation?
M: That's very easy in Europe because many British people buy holiday villas which they let to other people while they're not staying there themselves. They advertise in journals such as Dalton's Weekly, Excbange & Mart and in Sunday newspapers.

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

This is one year after the 9/11 attack. CNN correspondent Paula Sean is at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport Friday morning, talking about people's weekend traveling preceding Memorial Day.

People in the travel industry as well as passengers say the sobering effects from 9/11 are having a big impact on all of that. But if there is a hint of good news, people seem to be regaining their confidence in the airline industry. More Americans are going to be flying this weekend than at any other time since September 11.

Now, we are at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport this morning with a look at the start of a very busy weekend air travel schedule. We are seeing pretty healthy lines for this time of the morning, both at check-in outside and at the ticketing counters inside as well.

It is a far different world today than it was last Memorial Day, and what a year ago would have been perceived perhaps as an inconvenience is now being embraced as extra security checks. Even if there is any irritation from the long lines or extra security checks, the passengers that we talked to so far aren't showing it. Patience is going to be the key word.

As estimated, a quarter of a million people are going to be flying out of Hartsfield Airport today. That's only up slightly from a Friday average, but across the country, 4.1 million people are going to be flying today. That is actually down 7 percent from last year.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Ruth Roebke, a family consultant is talking about one thing that he and his family usually do during Christmas.

'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' I have often wondered about the validity of this statement. Where is the blessing in giving away something I would like to keep for myself? It might be more blessed, but it certainly is not more fun. Or is it?
For the past several years, my family has helped with the local effort to give to the needs of the poor in our community during the holidays. We have each helped in a different aspect as schedules and talents allowed.
The participation of many people is required to make this project happen. A volunteer committee organizes names, food, and gifts; school children blitz the community asking for canned contributions; high school students raise money and collect food; the grocery store donates a variety of resources; one family decorates the gift boxes; home schooled children sort donations; local citizens buy presents for the children; and area veterans pack and distribute the groceries and gifts.
As I have observed these volunteers giving time, wisdom, and resources, I have seen the blessings of giving: generosity, sympathy, memories, new relationships, and a job well done.
Yet, even more than these blessings, I sense God's pleasure as He watches families within a community work together to give to others. I can think of nothing more wonderful to receive than God's pleasure. Yes, it is true. It is more blessed to give than to receive.

## Passage

The Story of Mother's Day

The earliest Mother's Day celebrations can be traced back to the spring celebrations of ancient Greece in honor of Rhea, the Mother of the Gods. During the 1600's, England celebrated a day called "Mothering Sunday". Celebrated on the 4th Sunday of Lent, "Mothering Sunday" honored the mothers of England.

During this time many of the England's poor worked as servants for the wealthy. As most jobs were located far from their homes, the servants would live at the houses of their employers. On Mothering Sunday the servants would have the day off and were encouraged to return home and spend the day with their mothers. A special cake, called the mothering cake, was often brought along to provide a festive touch.
As Christianity spread throughout Europe the celebration changed to honor the "Mother Church" - the spiritual power that gave them life and protected them from harm. Over time the church festival blended with the Mothering Sunday celebration. People began honoring their mothers as well as the church.
In the United States Mother's Day was first suggested in 1872 by Julia Ward Howe as a day dedicated to peace. Ms. Howe would hold organized Mother's Day meetings in Boston every year.
In 1907 Ana Jarvis, from Philadelphia, began a campaign to establish a national Mother's Day. Ms. Jarvis persuaded her mother's church in Grafton, West Virginia to celebrate Mother's Day on the second anniversary of her mother's death, the second Sunday of May. By the next year Mother's Day was also celebrated in Philadelphia.
Ms. Jarvis and her supporters began to write to ministers, businessmen, and politicians in their quest to establish a national Mother's Day. It was successful as by 1911 Mother's Day was celebrated in almost every state. President Woodrow Wilson, in 1914, made the official announcement proclaiming Mother's Day as a national holiday that was to be held each year on the second Sunday of May.
While many countries of the world celebrate their own Mother's Day at different times throughout the year, there are some countries such as Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, and Belgium which also celebrate Mother's Day on the second Sunday of May.
