## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Zhang, a Chinese visiting scholar, is talking about a new dining trend in the United States with Susan, an American psychologist.  
中国访问学者张先生与美国心理学家苏珊女士探讨美国餐饮新潮流。

Zhang: Susan, I've heard a lot recently about cooking at table side. They say it is a new dining trend in the States. What is it?
Susan: An out-dated style that has come back to fashion, to be more accurate.
Zhang: I don't quite get it, I'm afraid.
Susan: As a matter of fact, cooking at table side has always been part of traditional haute cuisine, or art of cooking. Only this mode of serving food has been overlooked for years and is coming back strong in the United States.
Zhang: I see, but what is cooking at table side like?
Susan: Flaming steaks, for example. The waiter puts a plate of steaks on your table. He pours some alcoholic drink like brandy over it and lights it to produce some dramatic effects. You have similar things back in China, I'm sure.
Zhang: Oh yeah, and flaming bananas, too.
Susan: Exactly.
Zhang: So it should be called flaming at table side.
Susan: Come on, Zhang. Didn'tI say “for example"? Flaming is only part
of the story. In the current cooking-at-table-side style, diners are doing much more than that at the table.
Zhang: For example?
Susan: Slicing, saucing, boning and dicing.
Zhang: Dicing?
Susan: Yes, cutting things into smal cubes, in other words.
Zhang: But aren't the diners doing kitchen work?
Susan: Part of it perhaps.
Zhang: So is it any diferent from dining in the kitchen? I mean the whole business of cooking at table side.
Susan: You're being sarcastic, aren't you?
Zhang: I'm just telling the truth of it, don't you think?

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Jenet is buying some food at a shop.  
珍妮特正在商店买一些食物。

Clerk: Hi. May I help you, Ma'am?
Janet: Yes, please. I'd like some ham. I usually have Virginia ham, but I feel like something else for a change. What would you suggest?
Clerk: What do you think of boiled ham, Ma'am? It's tastier and it has less salt. Also, boiled ham has fewer calories than Virginia ham.
Janet: Yeah. Let me have the boiled ham then.
Clerk: How much, Ma'am?
Janet: A half pound, please.
Clerk: No problem.
Janet: And, oh, I need a quarter pound of domestic Swiss cheese.
Clerk: Domestic Swiss? Do you usually buy domestic Swiss?
Janet: Why not?
Clerk: Well, have you ever tried imported Swiss? It has a richer flavor than domestic.
Janet: Well, ah ... I think I'll stick with the domestic.
Clerk: Oh, that's okay.
Janet: Could I have some potato salad, please?
Clerk: Potato salad.
Janet: About a pound.
Clerk: Okay. You want the German style or American style?
Janet: American style, please.
Clerk: Fine. Anything else, Ma'am?
Janet: No, that's all, I think. How much do I owe you?
Clerk: $3.99, Ma'am.
Janet: Here's a ten.
Clerk: Thank you. Here's your change, Ma'am.
Janet: Thank you. Goodbye.
Clerk: Goodbye, Ma'am. Thanks for coming.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Tom and Sally are talking about a recent study of salt intake.  
汤姆和莎莉正在讨论一项关于盐摄入量的最新研究。

Sally: Listen, Tom. According to the people at the Institute of Medicine, even if you rarely season your food with it, you're still likely consuming too much salt.
Tom: How come?
Sally: It says that because of processed foods, most of us eat double the upper limit of salt.
Tom: Does it mean that we are taking in about 4,800 mg a day? Incredible! How did they come about the findings?
Sally: Don't reach your conclusion too hastily. The IOM, or the Institute of Medicine, has issued new guidelines. Instead of the current upper limit of 2,400 mg a day, the new recommended amount is 1,500 mg for healthy people of ages ranging from 9 to 50, and even less for others.
Tom: So the comparison is made between the current upper limit and the IOM's new value, isn't it?
Sally: That's right. In fact, the IOM has cut the recommended upper limit nearly by half, because, according to them, our current intake of salt raises the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and stomach cancer.
Tom: Isn't it another salt scare?
Sally: Better take it seriously. These days we can't be too cautious with what we eat.
Tom: Okay. What's to be done then? Read the lables carefully before we buy any food?
Sally: Too early. Food labels won't reflect this change just yet.
Tom: But how can we find foods that contain less salt?
Sally: At least we can cut back on foods like cold cuts, dressings and canned soups.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Sam and Li Ming are talking about how to make an apple pie.  
萨姆和李明正在讨论如何做苹果派。

Li Ming: Sam, I hear you Americans eat apple pies a lot. Do you know how to make one?
Sam: Sure. I'm a very good cook, you know. My favorite is apple pie with cheddar crust.
Li Ming: Cheddar crust?
Sam: Cheddar is a kind of cheese. Crust is the outside part of a pie.
Li Ming: I see. What do you need for the crust?
Sam: Flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, pepper, ice water, butter and cheddar.
Li Ming: What do you do with these things?
Sam: Combine the first five ingredients. Cut in butter. When the mixture resembles coarse meal, put in cheese and water. Stir the mixture until it leaves sides of the bowl. Shape it into a flat disk and wrap in plastic. Chill it for an hour. Then it's time to make the filling.
Li Ming: What do you need for the filling, then?
Sam: Peeled and thinly sliced apples, sugar, flour, lemon juice and some flavoring. Mix all the ingredients in a glass pie plate. On a floured surface, roll the crust mixture into a round shape. Cover the apples with the round crust mixture. Bake for 20 minutes on a baking sheet preheated to 450℃. Then reduce heat to 350℃ and bake 20 minutes more.
Li Ming:That's all?
Sam:Yes, the apple pie is ready to serve.
Li Ming:Sounds easy, doesn't it?
Sam: Easier said than done. It takes a lot of practice. There're many good cookbooks, but we don't have as many good cooks.
Li Ming: Absolutely.

## Passage

What could be more French than an outdoor market on a sunny Sunday morning? The air is filled with vital fragrances from the fruits and vegetables piled high in the greengrocers' creative layouts. A trace of the Atlantic blows off the shellfish on the fishmonger's bed of ice.

This, you think, is the very essence of France, until you read those little signs that tell you the tomatoes (which are really pretty tasteless) come from Moroccan hothouses, the grapes from South Africa, and the kiwis from Chile.

For generations, the French have prided themselves on their distinctiveness. Nothing has stood for France's sense of exceptionalism more famously than its cooking. Gallic talent, taste and techniques have been exported all over the world. And therein lies part of the problem. From the Thames to Tokyo, non-French cooks have cracked the codes of the best French cuisine. Meanwhile, what was mediocre elsewhere has been imported. (Believe it or not, one restaurant associated with a famous Paris chef serves steak with a sauce that's indistinguishable from the stuff on a Big Mac.) The result: many tourists - as well as the French themselves - no longer see what's so special about French cooking.

The decline goes well beyond recent surveys that show growing complaints about mediocre quality and high prices. More and more restaurant-owners say that government tax and economic policies are limiting their profits, and thereby hurting their capacity to invest and hire more staff. They have got stuck in the red tape for which France is infamous - not to mention regulations from Brussels that affect everything from sales taxes to the bacteria in the Brie cheese. Many warn that expanding the European Union to the east will hurt small French farmers, who remain the backbone of traditional cuisine - and, hence, French identity: Unfortunately for the French, there are few reassuring answers to these questions.

France's problem isn't the lack of creativity, but rather an unfavorable political environment for creativity. If you're choked by bureaucracy and taxes, as so much of France is, “there's not much you can do," says Raymond Blanc, born in the Jura region of France and chef of the two-star hotel-restaurant Manoir aux Quat'saisons. “I can open a business in England in five days. In France it would take three months." The Manoir aux Quat'saisons, by the way, is in Oxford, Britain, France's ancient rival. And, when it comes to cooking, a future one as well.
