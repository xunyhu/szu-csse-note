# Holidays and Festivals

## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Listen to a talk on the Chinese Moon Festival.

The Chinese Moon Festival, or sometimes called the Mid-Autumn Festival, takes place on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. The festival dates back to the Tang dynasty 618 A.D. and celebrates the biggest and brightest full moon of the year, the harvest moon.

There are ancient legends to explain the holiday. One is about a builder or architect named Hou Yih. Hou Yih built a beautiful jade palace for the Goddess of the Western Heaven or sometimes called the Royal Mother. The Goddess was so happy that she gave Hou Yih a special pill that contained the magic elixir of immortality. But with it came the condition and warning that he may not use the pill until he had accomplished certain things.

Hou Yih had a beautiful wife named Chang-O. Chang-O was as curious as she was beautiful. One day she found the pill and without telling her husband, she swallowed it. The Goddess of the Western Heaven was very angry and as a punishment, Chang-O was banished to the moon where, according to the legend, Chang-O can be seen at her most beautiful on the night of the bright harvest moon.

The Moon Festival is a big holiday with family reunions, moon gazing activities, and feasting on “moon cakes which are round pastries filed with red bean paste, fruit or jam. Especially exciting are the dragon and lion dances done during the festival. The origins of these dances also date back to ancient China.

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

A man is making a complaint to the travel agency about his holiday in Portugal last week.

W: Good morning, can I help you?
M: I'd like to make a complaint about my holiday in Portugal last week.
W: I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly was the problem?
M: First of all the coach taking us to the hotel broke down and we had to wait for over two hours in the sweltering heat before a replacement arrived. Then when we got to the hotel we found our room hadn't been cleaned.
W: Oh dear, did you complain to the hotel staff?
M: Of course, but we were told all the chambermaids were off duty. Anyway, that's not all. The people in the room above sounded like they were having all-night parties, every night. I demanded another room but the receptionist told me the hotel was full.
W: Oh, I see.
M: And to cap it all the food in the hotel restaurant was awful. It was so bad we had to eat out all the time despite having paid for meals in the price of our holiday.
W: I do apologize. I'd like to offer you a 20% discount on the price of one of our autumn breaks as a gesture of goodwill.
M: A 20% discount, you must be joking. I want to see the manager.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Wang Ling is asking Tim about how to spend the winter vacation, and they are mentioning the Chinese New Year.

Wang: Hi, Tim, are you going back to the States during the winter break?
Tim: No. One of my students will invite me to his hometown, especially to see how they will celebrate the Chinese New Year.
Wang: Really? How exciting! I guess people in the countryside must still follow some traditional ways to celebrate Spring Festival that the urban people no longer do.
Tim: So, you mean there are differences in the celebration between cities and the country?
Wang: Right. The same ways include getting together and spending the New Year's Eve preparing Chinese dumplings or jiaozi, and giving out money packets to children. You can't imagine, a child may receive over a thousand yuan during the festival.
Tim: That's the quickest way to get rich! How about the differences?
Wang: Well, I myself have never had the experience, I just learned them from books. One is not cleaning for the first few days of the New Year, for it's said, if you do any sweeping during this time, you risk sweeping away your good luck.
Tim: No wonder my student says they will do a good cleaning right before the holiday. Anything else?
Wang: Another one is offering a sacrifice to the Kitchen God. Many families have a poster of the Kitchen God in their kitchen. The custom is to offer a ceremonial sacrifice to the Kitchen God, to make sure that he gives a good report on the family's behavior when he returns to heaven. Sticky Cake is popular, or children may rub honey on him.
Tim: Interesting! I can't wait to go and see how they will do it.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Listening to a talk about the Harvest Home festival in the West.

Among the oldest known festivals, harvest feasts have existed for thousands of years. Ancient peoples offered the year's first ripe grains to the gods in thanks for the crops that would sustain their communities for the coming year.
In autumn, after farmers had reaped all of their harvest, they hosted a “harvest home" feast for members of their community. Customarily, participants in the feast would make a corn dolly, a symbolic or decorative figure made of straw. People believed that the dolly contained the spirit of a successful harvest, so when the feasting had ended, they took the dolly to a farmhouse where they stored it until the next harvest supper.
Today in the English-speaking world, people celebrate the Harvest Home festival as an unofficial religious holiday, usually observed on a Sunday in late September or early October. Since the mid-19th century it has become customary during the Harvest Home festival to decorate churches with fruit and vegetables.
Most countries of the world celebrate the end of the harvest with a feast. In the United States, the ancient harvest festivals of Europe helped give rise to contemporary Thanksgiving Day celebrations. In parts of Germany, people march to harvest festivals carrying a harvest crown similar to the corn dolly. In France, some communities celebrate the end of the grage-picking season by holding harvest feasts.

## Passage

Holidays are characterized by a partial or total stoppage of work and normal business activities and are generally accompanied by public and private ceremonies, including feasting, parades and carnivals, or displays of flags and speechmaking. Originally, in ancient times, holidays were predominantly religious in character and linked to natural events such as the annual course of the sun or the phases of the moon. The word "holiday", in fact, is derived from "holy day". Subsequently, secular holidays commemorating historical occasions or distinguished persons outnumbered holy days, although many ancient religious rituals and customs have been carried over into modern times and incorporated into both secular and religious observations. Today, the outstanding holiday is one of religious observance and abstention from normal work routines, taking place on Sunday for Christians, Friday for Muslims, and Saturday for Jews. In the U.S., Sunday is not only a non-religious holiday but also the only common-law holiday. National holidays are days set aside by official government proclamation to celebrate such occasions as the achievement of independence, the founding of the nation, the adoption of a constitution, the birthday of the ruler, or the national patron saint's day.
The U.S. has no national holidays as such legal holidays — days on which banks, schools, or other public institutions and most places of business are closed — are designated by legislative enactment or by executive proclamation. Congress and the president designate the legal holidays for the District of Columbia and the federal territories but are without power to declare national holidays. Independence Day and other holidays are observed on a national scale as a result of action by the states. In the case of Thanksgiving Day the president proclaims the calendar date and requests national observance, and the states then usually enact the necessary legislation. Federal statutes often specify certain days as holidays for purposes related to the legislation.
In order to give federal employees three-day weekends, a 1968 federal law made several changes in dates of holiday observances, effective in 1971: Washington's Birthday now falls on the third Monday in February; Memorial Day, on the last Monday in May; Columbus Day, on the second Monday in October; and Veterans Day, on the fourth Monday in October. Individual states later adopted these Monday holidays.
A number of states commemorate important events in their history. In Vermont, for example, the Battle of Bennington, fought in the American Revolution, is commemorated annually on August 16; in Louisiana the Battle of New Orleans of the War of 1812 is commemorated on January 8; Patriot's Day, commemorating the first battle of the American Revolution, is celebrated on or about April 19 in Massachusetts and Maine; and several southern states celebrate a Confederate Memorial Day on different days in the spring.
