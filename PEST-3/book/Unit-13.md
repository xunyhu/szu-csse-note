## Dialogue/Monoglogue 1

Jack is looking around in a jewelry shop. A shop assistant goes up to him to talk with him.
Assistant: May I help you, sir?
Jack: I'd like to buy a pearl necklace for my friend. Do you have suitable ones?
Assistant: Sure, sir. How about this one? It's pure white and the price is moderate.
Jack: How much does it cost?
Assistant: The price is marked on the label. It's five hundred yuan.
Jack: It's a lovely one. Is it made of natural pearls?
Assistant: No, sir, these are cultured pearls. But they look as beautiful as natural ones.
Jack: Yes, quite so. I'll take it.
Assistant: Anything else, sir?
Jack: Yes. I'd like to buy a brooch, a brooch with a diamond.
Assistant: All right. This brooch is really nice with a violet imitation diamond. It's a new design. Besides, it only costs fifty yuan.
Jack: I'll take both. Thank you.

## Dialogue/Monoglogue 2

Hawkins is a young salesman who has just left college with a degree in psychology. Now he is receiving Mary, a customer looking for a fur coat in his store. Hawkins has more interest in her motive for purchase.

Hawkins: Are you being attended to, Miss?
Mary: I'd like to see a fur coat for winter.
Hawkins: All right. How about this one, Miss? It suits you well.
Mary: What's the material of it?
Hawkins: It is made of fur from a fox. High quality, isn't it?
Mary: Yes. What's the price of it?
Hawkins: Nine thousand yuan, Miss.
Mary: I like it but it's a litle too expensive. Can you offer me a discount?
Hawkins: I'm afraid not, Miss. That's our rock bottom price. I think it's moderate enough. Well, let me ask you this question: do you want the fur coat because you need it? Or have you just had a quarrel with your husband and are trying to get even by making such an expensive purchase?
Mary: I beg your pardon?
Hawkins: Perhaps you suspect him of something, and you think this is the only way you can get back at him.
Mary: I have no idea what you are talking about.
Hawkins: Spending money on anger is a very expensive form of hostility. My advice to you is to think it over for a few days. Try to patch up your differences. Buying a new fur coat won't save your marriage.
Mary: I'll take your advice. Thank you very much.

## Dialogue/Monoglogue 3

A woman is talking about the advantages and disadvantages of buying groceries at both online supermarkets and physical stores.

I'm a professional woman. With a family of 5 - my husband and 3 children — to feed, I have to buy a lot of groceries every week. By comparison, I find both online grocery supermarket and physical grocery store have their advantages and disadvantages.

The major online grocery supermarket is set up to provide the most benefit to those who buy a lot of items and return frequently. It offers convenience, time and energy saving, and at reasonable prices. But its delivery charges are necessary unles my order is large enough to qualify for free delivery.

But if I were a housewife who doesn't value time saving, uses lots of coupons, and goes to two or three different physical grocery stores to pick up bargains, I would prefer the physical store in the neighborhood, where — aisle and shelf — to look for just about everything I would be likely to buy -- to buy with my heart at rest. But it takes time to get there and return home, especially to get through the long checkout line. Besides,I would spend more money than expected each time because of the attractive goods on hand.

On the whole, I prefer to shop on the Net grocery supermarket. As I'm always busy with my profession, time is as precious as gold. As I'm always tired, I enjoy sitting before the computer and having my groceries delivered at the door, only with a mouse clicked in any hand. That's the feeling I really enjoy very much.

## Dialogue/Monoglogue 4

Laurence is asking Teri Goldberg, who has much experience in online shopping, about how to shop online.

Laurence: I've little knowledge about online shopping. Can you tell me something about it?
Goldberg: Certainly. Cyber shopping isn't that different from shopping in the brick-and-mortar world. Both have advantages and disadvantages. In the physical world, you can feel everything. But cyberspace offers convenience; you are provided with global access to all sorts of goods. If you do shop online, remember you also need to shop smart.
Laurence: Is there any rule to pay attention to?
Goldberg: Yes, several. First, shop at known entities. You may divide cyber retailers into three subsets and attack each with a different strategy. The first subset is name-brand retailers that have established online shops. The advantage is you can always track down a live person. The second is cyber-only shops. By now, many of these shops have gained their own reputation. The last group is mom and pop online ventures stocking unusual items. Remember always shop at secure sites.
Laurence: How can I tell a site is secure or not?
Goldberg: That's the second rule. Any secure site, which can prevent a third party from seeing the information, is usually designed with an “s" after the “http:" windows. The payment will be safe on such sites. You may as well pay with a credit card, since chances of stealing a credit-card number online are pretty small.
Laurence: Then what if I bought fake goods or was charged unreasonably?
Goldberg: That's the last rule. Know where to file a complaint. It's always best to resolve your concerns directly with the retailer. But if impossible, consider filing a complaint at Truste.com because it can moderate disputes between the consumer and the company.
Laurence: Ok, thank you for your advice.

## Passage

Buying Computers and Software

At first, I was reluctant to buy computer products completely online. Many of the online computer stores used to sel exclusively through printed catalogs, addressing the needs of the technicaly astute. I found those printed catalogs intimidating and confusing. and preferred to go to a physical store, where knowledgeable sales people could guide me through the maze of choices, explaining the benefits and risks and costs.
When Egghead, the prominent software retailer, closed its physical stores and decided to operate solely online, Iwas shocked and disappointed, as I had shopped hardware or software regularly at the local Egghead store and depended on expertise, judgment and advice from their sales people. Also, I greatly valued the fact that when I bought new add-ons or upgrades for my PC, I could pay to have them instaled on the spot. But now Iwas forced to learn more about computers than I ever expected to learn. As it turns out, that's probably a good thing for me and for my budget.
Today, the computer industry is a commodity, standards-driven marketplace. Computer "manufacturers" are really just assemblers. They buy processors from one source, software, disks, memory from other sources, and assemble them into systems. The competition is fierce and the profit margins are slim. In terms of the basic specs — speed, memory, and storage - what we now define as a “complete system” for home use would have made a wealthy technical guru tremble with jealousy ten years ago.
Fifteen years ago, it seemed inconceivable that an ordinary individual would ever need a 100 MHz machine with 1 gigabyte of disk storage space. Yet, with the predictable improvement of technology, the speed of commercially available processors doubles about every 18 months according to a rule of thumb (known as "Moore's Law"). While, at some point, technology must meet barriers that will slow the pace of change, the computer industry has been adapting at this incredibly rapid rate for more than two decades now, with great regularity. And the software industry has been keeping in lock step with these hardware developments by making each new version of the common applications that people depend upon more and more complex and bulky, requiring the full capacity of the latest and greatest hardware. I believe this software inflation results from the consequences of human nature - software expands to fil the capacity available for it.
Basically, "Moore's Law" plus software inflation mean today's computer system wil not last. And the new versions of software will make your equipment seem painfully slow in two years, and obsolete in four. To stay compatible with other people with whom you have to share files, you should invest time learning about these add-ons, gadgets, etc. to upgrade your system. Thus you can make full use of the shopping resources on the Internet, and save again and again.
