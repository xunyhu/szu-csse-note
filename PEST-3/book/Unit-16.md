## Dialogue/Monologue 1

A tourist is asking a passerby for directions to the Tourist Information Center.

Tourist: Excuse me. I'm trying to locate the Tourist Information Center. The hotel clerk said it was about five blocks this side of the center of town, but I've been walking for quite a while now and can't seem to find it.
Passerby: You just haven't walked far enough yet. It's about a ten-minute walk from here, I'd say.
Tourist: Would you mind drawing me a little map on this piece of paper? I always seem to get lost when I try to follow directions.
Passerby: Yes, it is easier to follow a map. Okay. You go straight along this avenue for about 200 yards; then when you come to this bend in the road, turn right.
Tourist: Is there any landmark at that bend?
Passerby: Let me think. Yes, there's a Shell station on the left, across the street. Then after you turn, just walk for another five or six minutes. You'll see a big sign. You can't miss it.

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

A tourist wants to go to the Brooklyn Museum and asks a passerby for directions.

Tourist: Excuse me . could you tell me if this is where I can catch a bus to the Brooklyn Museum?
Passerby: Yes, you're at the right stop, but that bus comes only every half hour to 45 minutes. Besides, I don't think it goes directly to Brooklyn. I know it makes a lot of stops.
Tourist: Sounds like it takes a long time to get there.
Passerby: It does . especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy. Why don't you take the subway? It's a lot faster.
Tourist: I just can't seem to understand the New York subway system at all. As soon as I get underground I lose my sense of direction.
Passerby: But it's easy to get to Brooklyn from here.
Tourist: Well .. do you know where the nearest subway station is?
Passerby: About a block down from here. Say, I'm going in that direction. I'll show you where it is.
Tourist: Thanks a lot.
Passerby: Think nothing of it. The museum's about eight stops down. You get off at Eastern Parkway. And you don't have to make any changes.
Tourist: It sounds easy. Maybe this time I won't get lost!

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

May Hunter is at a travel conference and exhibition in Manchester, England. She is talking about her first and second day there.

Hello, I'm May Hunter. I'm at a travel exhibition in Manchester, England.

Manchester is a fantastic place! It's full of life, lots to see and do in the evenings. Yesterday was my first day. I checked in at the hotel and then went out to Chinatown, which has some great Chinese restaurants and things to see. I love that kind of atmosphere and the wonderful Chinese supermarkets and clothes shops. I want to go back there later to do some shopping.

In the end, I found a restaurant which had more than 50 special dishes. It seems as if I am going to enjoy myself here for the coming days.
Today, I went back to work! I went to the conference to register and to set up my exhibition stand.

I found everything ready for us. The registration was easy and straightforward, and the people were friendly. I discussed the conference with the manager. I found that the stand of my company is in a good position, near the coffee shop and the bakery. So I should get lots of people passing by and buying my holidays and tours.

Things are going well! I set our brochures ready for the official opening, and then I went to look at the other stands. This afternoon I want to go out again to do some shopping. I bought some presents for my boyfriend.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Sally Brown, a journalist, is talking with Peter Smith, a government official in charge of transport planning, about the transport policy he is working on.

Sally Brown: I believe you've been working on a transport policy for Britain. Can you explain what is special about your plan?

Peter Smith: Yes, certainly. First of all, Britain is unique in its transport history.

Sally Brown: Why's that?

Peter Smith: Because of all the transport systems that have been developed in the last 300 years. By the year 1700, Britain had a whole network of canals and rivers. Coal could be moved from Welsh mining villages right into the heart of London.

Sally Brown: But surely, the canal system is much too slow for industry today.

Peter Smith: Not necessarily. With a bit of forward planning, we could still move construction materials by waterway, though I'd agree that the main potential of the canal routes today is their recreational use. They are ideal for people who really want to relax and live life at a slower pace.

Sally Brown: What do you propose for industry then?

Peter Smith: Well, Britain's rail network is still second to none.

Sally Brown: But wagons can't deliver goods from door to door. By the time you've loaded them onto a truck, you might as well do the whole journey by road.

Peter Smith: That doesn't necessarily follow. A lot of our trade is with Europe and before the Channel Tunnel, there was a very good container industry. The containers could either be hooked onto lorries or loaded onto ships. Why not adapt the rail network to allow it to cope with containers?
Sally Brown: You couldn't have loading bays and cranes at every station along the line.
Peter Smith: No, but you could have freight terminals in each of our major cities. Loading could take place during the night to avoid congestion.
Sally Brown: How do people fit into your plan?
Peter Smith: Well firstly, there will be limitations on the number of private cars. You will still be able to rent a car for journeys between cities, but it will always be cheaper to take the family on the train. There will be taxis to cross town, but it will naturally be more economical to use bicycles and buses or to walk. Disabled people will be given taxi vouchers and there will still be ambulances driven by professionals.

## Passage

Washington, D.C. serves as the seat of government for the United States of America. Over the course of over 200 years, Washington, D.C. has grown with the nation, and it now represents the very best of America. From its majestic monuments to its incomparable museums, from the Mall to the steps of the Capitol, Washington offers visitors one-of-a-kind attractions. The majestic Capitol building stands at the center of the city, allowing unobstructed views of the city's most famous attractions. The immense open space of the Mall is marked off by the various museums of the Smithsonian Institution, the largest cluster of museums in the world. The National Air and Space Museum celebrates the nation's achievements in flight and space exploration, from the Wright brothers' first biplane to the Apollo moon mission and beyond. Visitors also line up for the Natural History Museum to learn about the sciences and to view the famous Hope Diamond. The Smithsonian Institution also includes the world-famous galeries. Art lovers should also appreciate the nearby National Portrait Gallery and National Museum of American Art.
Looking past the Mal, the Washington Monument stands 505 feet above the city. It was the tallest man-made structure in America from its completion until the early 1900's. Behind this monument are the reflecting pool and the trio of memorials dedicated to remembering President Lincoln and the wounded and killed of the Vietnam and Korean conflicts. New to the area of the tidal basin, and facing the Jefferson Memorial, a memorial to Franklin Roosevelt lies on the Potomac River which hosts millions of visitors each year.
The offices of the various government agencies take up most of the space of the city, and most offer free tours to the public. The White House also offers free tours to the public. Just outside of the city, the National Zoo houses thousands of animals on 163 acres of park. Among its residents are two giant pandas given to the United States as gifts from the People's Republic of China. Across the river in Arlington, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier stands amidst the dim, grave and majestic Arlington National Cemetery.
Washington has many other distractions from politics. Washington's theatre life is thriving; it is second only to New York in number of theatre seats. The National Symphony and other musical companies play full schedules. As a temporary home to diplomats from around the world, Washington's restaurant offerings are the finest and most diverse around.
The beauty and grandeur of the nation's capital continue to captivate millions of American and foreign tourists who visit Washington, D.C. each year.
