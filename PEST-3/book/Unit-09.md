2004 TUC launched "Work Your Proper Hours Day" where workers were encouraged to take the lunch breaks they usually work through and leave for home at their contracted time. The following is the news report.  
2004 年，英国工会大会发起“工作时间合理日”，鼓励工人在平时工作的午休时间休息，并在合同规定的时间内回家。以下是新闻报道。

Here's one for your diary. Friday, February 25 is the day in 2005 when the TUC estimates that people who do unpaid overtime will stop working for free and start to get paid. The TUC is urging people who do unpaid overtime to “work your proper hours" on that day, taking a proper lunch-break, and arriving and leaving work on time. This should remind Britain's employers just how much they depend on the goodwill and voluntary extra work of their staff, the TUC says. Indeed the TUC is urging Britain's bosses to take their staff out for lunch, coffee or a cocktail on "work your proper hours day" to say thank you for their hard work and commitment. "This will be an annual event," said TUC head of campaigns, Nigel Stanley. "Every so often even people who love their jobs and are happy to put in extra hours want to be told they are not taken for granted. And if it makes people and employers think a bit harder about organizing a better work-life balance, so much the better.

Both Clare and Doris are majoring in sociology. Now they are talking about the investigation that they are doing on “Beyond Nine-to-five”.

Clare: I think it is easy to get the idea from the media that, except in unusual cases, everyone works from nine in the morning to five in the evening, five days a week, in an office or plant of some kind.
Doris: Yes. In the stereotyped view of the job, there's a set time to start work, another to stop. But the examination of the work force, however, shows a great variety in work schedules and sites. Although Nine-to-five is generally thought of as the work day, many jobs are performed when Nine-to-five personnel are off the job. Most jobs, for example, in the entertainment industry are performed in off hours.
Clare: That's right. Monday through Friday is referred to as the work week. Still, many people do not work each and every weekday or during the five-day week exclusively.
Doris: And alternating shifts at stores and hospitals, for example, often have personnel working odd days. Many people work over the weekend, keeping stores and services in operation. Sunday and holiday work has its good side — time-and-a-half or double-time pay rates in some businesses.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Mr. Debiao Wang has been the head of the State Civil Administration Bureau for many years. He is now interviewed by a reporter.

Reporter: Hello, Mr. Wang. The government is by far the biggest enterprise in the country. One person out of eight in labor force is said to be employed by a government unit on the state or local level. Is that the case?
Mr. Wang: Yes. As the nation's largest employer the government offers the greatest number of jobs and careers. Almost anything a person studies in school will qualify him for some kind of government work. A typical state announcement lists job openings for architects, auditors, postmen, historians and radio announcers, just to name a few of the multitude of openings. In recent times, a major explosion in government work in scientific and health fields has created innumerable openings in those fields.
Reporter: I see. Then, how can people get the opportunity to work for the government?
Mr. Wang: Each citizen is supposed to have an equal opportunity to compete for state employment. By use of the merit system, which includes competitive examinations, appointments can be made on the basis of ability without regard to other considerations (politics, race, religion, sex or national origin). Women, for example, get equal pay with men for equal work; however, very few women occupy jobs in the higher grades.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Donald is running his own business. He explains to some of the staff why social life is sometimes very important.

Business-connected social life is often a real concern for a person in private enterprises. As an employee progresses in a particular company, it may account for a great deal of the social life for him and, if he is married, his wife. This kind of social life is, for some people, an important part of the job.
For younger or newer employees, low on the organization chart, business-connected social life is normally limited to attending office parties. They might be asked to dinner or a Christmas party at boss' house but they are not expected to return the invitation.
It is often said that more business is done during social events than at the office. For example, the business lunch is the standard combination of business and pleasure, during which serious matters are discussed over wine and contracts signed between the entrée and dessert. Anniversary dinners and benefits are, in the same way, occasions at which business can continue after office hours.

Conventions provide the opportunity for several days or more of new contacts and discussions, interrupted only by speeches and registrations.

## Passage

The United States supplies a larger share of the international trade than any other nation in the world. The transactions of trade between countries are often kept in American dollars, and payments are frequently made in American currency as well. Many American banks have established branches in important commercial centers overseas to handle the business that results from world trade. Similarly, many foreign banks also have branches in the United States.

The United States has many trading partners; one that has become increasingly important in recent years is China. The city of Shanghai in eastern China is one of the world's great seaports and has also become active in both manufacturing and finance in the world. Many American banks have set up offices there. John William is the manager of one of these branch banks in Shanghai.

John majored in accounting and business administration in Harvard. After graduation he got a job with a large New York bank. After two years in accounting, he was transferred to the loan department. Many of the loans which he was asked to consider involved international transactions. Some of them were so complicated that John felt he didn't have a broad enough background to understand them. To get more experience, he asked for a transfer to the bank's international department. He became so expert in international finance that he made it his career.
When the bank decided to open a branch in Shanghai, John was selected to set it up and run it for the first few years. He has been in Shanghai for more than three years now. He has a comfortable apartment in a high-rise building in the business center of the city. The bank provides him with a car and driver as well as the apartment.
Mandarin is the most common language of Shanghai, but John has learned only a few courtesy expressions. He has little need to speak Chinese, however, because all of the employees of the bank are fluent in English. His chief assistant, Miss Wang, went to graduate school in the States, so her English is excellent.
John has enjoyed being in Shanghai, but he may not be there much longer. Now that the bank is operating efficiently, he might be transferred back to New York in a few months. But he hopes to be back to China soon after for he loves it living there.
