## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Dave and Mary are talking about news they read on the Internet.

Dave: Anything interesting on the Internet?
Mary: Well, a lot. I am reading the gardening column written by Steve Mann. This guy is a genius.
Dave: Take a look at the domestic news part. There was a small earthquake yesterday in remote areas of the south.
Mary: Yeah, I've finished it. It says only some ancient temples collapsed but fortunately nobody died.
Dave: Look here, Swiss singer Gil was named the 2005 winner of the Polar Music Prize for his contributions to music.
Mary: Really? I love his music. I know Gil is already 79, and he is Switzerland's culture deputy minister now. By the way, the Polar Music Prize award was founded in 1989, right?
Dave: Yeah, it says it was founded by Thomas Anderson, manager of Swedish pop group ABBA, through a donation.
Mary: When did they announce the winner?
Dave: Let me see. Here, announcement of the winner was made yesterday. Gil will receive about 137,000 U.S. dollars and he is expected to travel to Sweden to collect the award on May 23.
Mary: Wow! Keep reading and tell me some more interesting things.
Dave: No problem!"

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Bob and Jean are talking about articles in the newspaper.

Bob: Hey, do you read the Globe and Mail? They've always got interesting news. Look here. Badminton news. Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms, the Olympic silver medalists, wil have to beat the double Olympic champions Zhang Jun and Gao Ling in the semi- finals of Yonex Al England Open Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham next week.
Jean: Oh, hope they can win this time. I also enjoy reading the Globe and Mail. What else is there?
Bob: Here is more.do you watch the TV show American Idol?
Jean: Yeah. I enjoy that. It is every Tuesday at 8, right? What does it say about it in the paper?
Bob: The University of North Carolina will offer an academic course about the show to promote it.
Jean: Interesting! When wil that start in the University?
Bob: Beginning of January. And the students can earn three credit points for the class. Hopefully there are more universities which will follow.
Jean: What is the course called?
Bob: Examining American Idol. The class will watch the show twice a week and learn the history of different musical styles used as themes of the show. The final project will be a paper on who should win and why.
Jean: I wish that I could take that course as well. Whose idea is that?
Bob: It is an elective course created by Jay Grymes, an assistant professor. He says he is a huge fan of the show.
Jean: Can I read the paper when you are done with it?
Bob: Sure.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Steve and Jane are watching CNN, a TV channel they both enjoy.

Steve: Hey, I know that you are watching TV. Can I join you?
Jane: Sure. I just finished my paper for the course so I am not guilty of not doing anything.
-060008
Steve: Well, I haven't finished yet. Anyway, I wil do some research tomorrow.
Jane: Hey, do you know that CNN will shut down its financial news network in December? It decided not to compete with CNBC anymore.
Steve: But they have been competing with each other for 9 years!
Jane: Yeah, they said instead of repeating 30-minute newscast they will offer some prime-time programs. The financial news of CNN is not so popular anyway.
Steve: That's right. I heard that among the 110 million national television homes it is only available in about 30 million homes.
Jane: They should really improve their programs. And their present satellite system is going to expire soon.
Steve: If that's so, then they are going to lose more people.
Jane: I think so. In 1995 when CNN was founded, people were more interested. Later, it was also hard to compete with the Internet. Actually both CNN and CNBC failed to gain popularity.
Steve: Luckily, their biggest star, Lou Dobbs came back 2 years after he left in 1999.
Jane: When they shut down the financial news network, 60 jobs will be gone!
Steve: But they say 100 new jobs will be added. Well, talking about jobs, I don't think I should be here discussing about CNN. I'd better go back to my study.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Tom and Lynn met in the swimming pool. They are talking about who is going to be the director general for Swimming Canada.

Tom: Hey,I haven't seen you for a while. How is everything?
Lynn: Great. Do you still come here a lot?
Tom: Yeah. I come here almost every other day. I cannot live without swimming.
Lynn: Today I heard people talking about the director general for Swimming Canada.
Tom: I know. They say that the candidates have been narrowed to four and Talbot is likely to win.
Lynn: Who is Talbot?
Tom: Well, he ran the national team for 10 years before helping Australia to become a world power.
Lynn: When will they appoint the director general?
Tom: The problem for Swimming Canada is that it has so much going on right now and it won't be able to appoint one until late November at the earliest.
Lynn: Yeah, the paper says that Muir will be interviewing coaches this weekend in Toronto. She will then recommend them to Swimming Canada at the meeting.
Tom: Muir? Is that the one who coached the Canadian champion?
Lynn: Yes. It was so disappointing that Canada didn't win any medals at the Olympic pool in Athens. Who will be the head coach?
Tom: The new director general will decide about the head coach.
Lynn: The new head coach will replace Dave Johnson, right?
Tom: Yes, he was fired shortly after the Athens Olympics because there were no medals. Hopefully they can improve next time in the Olympics."
