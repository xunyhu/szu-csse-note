# At Home

## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Karen has just had her house redecorated. Her friend Jenny is visiting her and they are talking about the decoration.

Jenny: You certainly do have a beautiful home. But how did you two find the time to fix it up so nicely?
Karen: Thanks, but we were lucky enough to have a professional, namely an architect to help us change the structure of the rooms. The architect and Tom put their heads together to discuss what we wanted and what was possible. After a few meetings, they came up with some super ideas that everybody agreed with.
Jenny: But it must've been pretty expensive, wasn't it?
Karen: Architects aren't very cheap, that's for sure. But the rest of it was surprisingly inexpensive. Many times, we didn't even have to buy materials. We were able to make do with the materials we already have. For example, I made up some of the curtains and pillows on the couch from mere sheets.
Jenny: What an interesting idea!
Karen: The real problem was the living room. It was really small and not at all special. The architect suggested adding a fireplace. That makes the room look bigger and gives it more character. We were really happy to make that breakthrough. It's funny how people can find solution after they kick something around for a while. Talking about it really helps.

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Meng Di is a pro at playing video games. He is now teaching Su Ling, his friend, how to play a video game on his home computer.

Meng Di: Come on, Su Ling. Try it. It's fun. Video games now prevail in the world. Millions of people play video games all the time. I have a good collection of video games and I often play them on my home computer.

Su Ling: Why don't you play a game or two first, so I can see how to do it.

Meng Di: OK. This game is called The Invaders from Space. This lever in the middle - we call it a joy stick - is how you move your gun across the bottom of the screen. The invaders will drop bombs at varying speeds from various places across the screen. Your job is to move your gun underneath them before the bombs hit the ground.

Su Ling: Do I shoot them?

Meng Di: Yes, by pressing this button over here. If you hold it down, it loads bullets automatically and fires continuously; otherwise, it only fires a burst when you depress it.

Su Ling: That's all there is to do it?
Meng Di: Well, not exactly. As the game progresses, the invaders come faster and faster and drop more bombs, so you have to move more rapidly and get the guns under them and blast them out of the sky. That's it. Okay, you're on your own.

Su Ling: Zap! Pow! Take that, you evil creatures! Oops, that one sneaked past me! Oh, bloody hell! He got me. The little devil was too fast, but I'll get him next time. I'll try again. Oh, this is fun!
Meng Di: You're becoming a pro at this game,
Su Ling. Your scores are getting higher and higher with this game. Would you like to move on to a more complicated game?
Su Ling: Eventually, but for now I'd like to concentrate on getting the best score ever on this game.
Meng Di: If you do that, Su Ling, you can enter your initials in the video display to show everyone that you got the highest score.
Su Ling: What a good idea! Why don't I come to your house tomorrow again and try my hand on some other games you have on the computer.
Meng Di: Su Ling, I think you're hooked.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Sara is a specialist of domestic science. She is now talking to new parents about how to ensure their children's safety at home.

Making your home safe for young children is a simple but very necessary project for you new parents.

First, you should locate any materials that could be dangerous or poisonous to children. These include detergent, ammonia, and medications. We know that even vitamins, when taken by the bottleful, can kill. Although some of these come with childproof safety caps, many times this is not enough to protect the child. The best thing to do with these materials is to put them in a high cabinet in your kitchen or bathroom. If your cabinets are low enough for a child to reach them, they should be kept locked.

Next, you should check electrical sockets and wiring. The sockets in your home should be covered with plastic blanks. These are available at most drug and department stores, and will prevent the child from putting his fingers into the sockets. Also, be sure that the wiring for lamps and other appliances doesn't become a plaything for your child. The wiring should be placed securely where the child cannot reach it, or it should at least be covered. This will help prevent electric shock by preventing the child from putting the wire in his mouth.

Finally, don't be careless. Don't leave sharp objects - knives, pins, and so on - lying around. And no matter how busy you are, always take time out to check that your child hasn't gotten hold of something that could hurt him.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Mei Xin used to be a career woman, but she quit her job and became a full-time housewife after she got married. She is now talking about her daily routine at home.  
梅心原本是一名职场女性，结婚后便辞去工作，做起了全职家庭主妇。她现在讲述着自己在家的日常生活。

I'm a full-time housewife, happy and fully-engaged every day. I've been married for 12 years, but quit my job and took up housekeeping the year after my marriage. Daily household chores keep me on my toes; I'm delighted all day long. Humming like a bee around the house, I've never had the feeling of boredom and inanity.

Here's my daily routine: first thing in the morning, make coffee for my husband. As he never has breakfast without me, I watch him eat and drink till it's through. Then he puts on the clean clothes I chose for him the night before. While I see my beloved walking out of the house beamingly and briskly out of my sight, my heart blooms with joy and satisfaction.

Turning round delightedly, I start taking care of my darling kittens, washing and drying them one by one, altogether four. Then I begin cleaning up the house step by step, wiping and polishing every surface and corner, till everywhere, everything in the house looks bright and clean. How I love hearing my husband say, "What a nice and comfortable home I have!" when he gets home!

In a moment, it's noontime. After a simple lunch for myself, I switch on the computer, work on my own website and browse among others. By 6:00 p.m. or so, it's time for me to get dinner ready. That's the 'tremendous business' for me out of the three meals a day, for, except for the weekends, my husband and I have only this meal together. Besides, he always has his lunch in a neglected way at his workplace. He needs nutrition from the dinner I prepared for him most of all.

## Passage

Mrs. Chambers sits comfortably in her armchair, enjoying a cup of coffee. She has the right to relax. She has had a long and very busy life.
Mrs. Chambers has retired now to a small house in Bangor, a popular seaside town not far from Belfast. But for most of her life she lived in the country. Her husband's farm was on an island in the middle of Strangford Lake. There, Mrs. Chambers baked bread twice a week, made jam every summer, and put her husband's dinner on the table at twelve o'clock exactly every day. The island farm had been owned by the Chambers family for many years, passing on from father to son. It was a quiet and beautiful place to live. They grew potatoes and vegetables, and kept hens and cows. When Mr. Chambers died, his son took on the farm, Mrs. Chambers moved away.
She takes another sip of coffee, and smiles as she remembers people from the past. “The old lady down the road thought she had a ghost in the house," she says, “but it was only old Tom MaAleer, frightening her for fun." The memories come fast. "Twenty men, they had, only ten years ago, to bring in the potato crop. Young Hugh has a machine now. He only needs five."
It's time for the news on TV. Mrs. Chambers wants to see the racing results. She won quite a lot of money last week. Next month she's going down to Tipperary in the Republic of Ireland. The horse-racing there is wonderful. She finds it hard to stay away. But before the racing results there's another item of news. A bomb has exploded in Belfast. Several people have been killed. Mrs. Chambers shakes her head. "They're all crazy," she says. "It's just a few who make all the trouble. The rest of us want to live in peace. We've all got life-long friends from both sides. And most of the time we never talk about the trouble.
The racing results come on. She leans forward to watch. For her, ordinary everyday life is the most important thing.
