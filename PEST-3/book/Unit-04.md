Mary is buying some books in a bookstore.
Mary 在书店买一些书

Clerk: Good afternoon, madam. What can I do for you?
Mary: Good afternoon. I'm looking for some books for my kids and their cousins.
Clerk: Christmas gifts, right?
Mary: Exactly.
Clerk: What kind of books?
Mary: Conservation-themed ones would be approved of, I think.
Clerk: Here are three picture books. They have just arrived. Look at this one, madam. A Cool Drink of Water.
Mary: What's it about?
Clerk: The universal importance of clean drinking water.
Mary: Good.
Clerk: And this one. Recycle Every Day. It tells the story of a smart family of rabbits that wisely reuses resources.
Mary: These pictures are beautiful, aren't they?
Clerk: And this is a picture book of the life story of Rachel Carson.
Mary: Oh, Rachel Carson. He is famous for vigorously opposing the use of chemicals to kill pests. Let me have a look at the book. Rachel: The Story of Racbel Carson. These picture books are perfect for my younger kids. I still need one for their elder brother. What would you recommend for a tenth-grader?
Clerk: What about this, ma'am? If The World Were a Village. It's about languages, religions and food from around the world.
Mary: That's it. He'll be interested. Now something for their cousins. One is interested in plant life and the other one is a sports fan.
Clerk: That's easy. Plants on tbe Trail With Lewis and Clark, about plant identification, and Golfing Giant, about how to become a golf expert.
Mary: Wonderful. You've been very helpful, indeed.
Clerk: My pleasure, ma'am. That's $45.98. Would you please pay at the cashier counter over there while I wrap these books for you?
