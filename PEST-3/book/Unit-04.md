## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Chen, a `visiting scholar` from China, and his American `landiady` Sally are talking about an article in Nature.  
来自中国的`访问学者`陈和他的美国`旅伴`莎莉正在讨论《自然》杂志上的一篇文章。

Chen: Sally, I've just read an article in the `latest issue` of Nature, and there's some bad news.  
陈：莎莉，我刚刚读了《自然》杂志`最新一期`上的一篇文章，里面有一些坏消息。

Chen: According to a new study by some Singaporean scientists, by the end of this `century`, `up to 42 percent` of animal `species` in `Southeast Asia` could become `extinct`, `and worse still`, at least half of those species could disappear worldwide.  
陈：根据新加坡科学家的最新研究，到本`世纪`末，`东南亚`地区可能有`多达 42％`的动物` 物种``灭绝 `，`更糟糕的是`，全球范围内可能有至少一半的动物物种消失。

Sally: What's it?  
莎莉：什么事？

Sally: How did they `figure it out`?  
莎莉：他们是怎么发现的？

Chen: They used Singapore as a `microcosm` for examining a `regionwide` tropical biodiversity crisis, and `compiled` population data from the past two centuries.  
陈：他们以新加坡作为研究`区域性`热带生物多样性危机的`缩影`，并`汇编`了过去两个世纪的人口数据。  
They found out that as Singapore's forests have been `sacrificed` for agriculture and urban development, animals that `call the forest home` have suffered `enormously`.  
他们发现，由于新加坡的森林被`牺牲`用于农业和城市发展，`以森林为家`的动物遭受了`巨大损失`。  
In the past 80 years, `two thirds` of the 91 known forest-dependent species of birds in Singapore have become extinct.  
在过去的 80 年里，新加坡已知的 91 种依赖森林生存的鸟类中有`三分之二`已经灭绝。  
And the scientists used the current `deforestation` rate of about 74 percent over the past two centuries for the entire region of Southeast Asia.  
科学家们将过去两个世纪整个东南亚地区的`森林砍伐`率定为 74% 左右。

Sally: So deforestation is the `major cause`. They really shouldn't have destroyed those lovely forests. What a high price to pay for the `so- called development`.  
莎莉：所以砍伐森林是`主要原因`。他们真的不应该毁掉这些美丽的森林。`所谓的发展`付出了多么大的代价啊。

Chen: The study goes on to call for strong `measures` against illegal `logging` and hunting, and the `establishment` of nature `reserves`.  
陈：该研究还呼吁采取有力`措施`打击非法`砍伐`和狩猎，并`建立`自然`保护区`。

Sally: Too late, too late. The `sad truth` is that deforestation, illegal logging and hunting are still going on.  
莎莉：太晚了，太晚了。令人`悲哀的事实`是，砍伐森林、非法砍伐和狩猎仍在继续。

Chen: But isn't it better to realize what's wrong and start to do something than to `remain ignorant of the problem and let the situation stay`?  
陈：但是，认识到问题所在并开始采取行动不是比`对问题保持无知，让情况保持原样`更好吗？

Sally: Maybe you're right.  
莎莉：也许你是对的
