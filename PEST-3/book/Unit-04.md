## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Chen, a `visiting scholar` from China, and his American `landiady` Sally are talking about an article in Nature.  
来自中国的`访问学者`陈和他的美国`旅伴`莎莉正在讨论《自然》杂志上的一篇文章。

Chen: Sally, I've just read an article in the `latest issue` of Nature, and there's some bad news.  
陈：莎莉，我刚刚读了《自然》杂志`最新一期`上的一篇文章，里面有一些坏消息。

Chen: According to a new study by some Singaporean scientists, by the end of this `century`, `up to 42 percent` of animal `species` in `Southeast Asia` could become `extinct`, `and worse still`, at least half of those species could disappear worldwide.  
陈：根据新加坡科学家的最新研究，到本`世纪`末，`东南亚`地区可能有`多达 42％`的动物` 物种``灭绝 `，`更糟糕的是`，全球范围内可能有至少一半的动物物种消失。

Sally: What's it?  
莎莉：什么事？

Sally: How did they `figure it out`?  
莎莉：他们是怎么发现的？

Chen: They used Singapore as a `microcosm` for examining a `regionwide` tropical biodiversity crisis, and `compiled` population data from the past two centuries.  
陈：他们以新加坡作为研究`区域性`热带生物多样性危机的`缩影`，并`汇编`了过去两个世纪的人口数据。  
They found out that as Singapore's forests have been `sacrificed` for agriculture and urban development, animals that `call the forest home` have suffered `enormously`.  
他们发现，由于新加坡的森林被`牺牲`用于农业和城市发展，`以森林为家`的动物遭受了`巨大损失`。  
In the past 80 years, `two thirds` of the 91 known forest-dependent species of birds in Singapore have become extinct.  
在过去的 80 年里，新加坡已知的 91 种依赖森林生存的鸟类中有`三分之二`已经灭绝。  
And the scientists used the current `deforestation` rate of about 74 percent over the past two centuries for the entire region of Southeast Asia.  
科学家们将过去两个世纪整个东南亚地区的`森林砍伐`率定为 74% 左右。

Sally: So deforestation is the `major cause`. They really shouldn't have destroyed those lovely forests. What a high price to pay for the `so- called development`.  
莎莉：所以砍伐森林是`主要原因`。他们真的不应该毁掉这些美丽的森林。`所谓的发展`付出了多么大的代价啊。

Chen: The study goes on to call for strong `measures` against illegal `logging` and hunting, and the `establishment` of nature `reserves`.  
陈：该研究还呼吁采取有力`措施`打击非法`砍伐`和狩猎，并`建立`自然`保护区`。

Sally: Too late, too late. The `sad truth` is that deforestation, illegal logging and hunting are still going on.  
莎莉：太晚了，太晚了。令人`悲哀的事实`是，砍伐森林、非法砍伐和狩猎仍在继续。

Chen: But isn't it better to realize what's wrong and start to do something than to `remain ignorant of the problem and let the situation stay`?  
陈：但是，认识到问题所在并开始采取行动不是比`对问题保持无知，让情况保持原样`更好吗？

Sally: Maybe you're right.  
莎莉：也许你是对的

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Robin, a `Greenpeace` activist, is talking about a `U.S. - European` joint effort to develop `hydrogen-powered` `fuel` `cells` with his wife Barbara, a journalist.  
`绿色和平`组织活动人士罗宾正在与身为记者的妻子芭芭拉谈论`美国和欧洲`联合开发` 氢动力``燃料``电池 `的计划。

Barbara: Robin, isn't it good news that America and Europe will pool research into hydrogen-powered fuel cells?  
芭芭拉：罗宾，美国和欧洲将联手研究氢燃料电池，这难道不是好消息吗？

Robin: I don't think so.  
罗宾：我不这么认为。

Barbara: Why! The project `is expected to` speed the development of the first `commercial` fuel-cell cars or `home heating systems`. It shows the United States is out to make peace with `eco-friendly` Europe.  
芭芭拉：为什么！该项目`有望`加速首批`商用`燃料电池汽车或`家庭供暖系统`的开发。这表明美国愿意与`环保的`欧洲和平相处。

Robin: At first glance, it seems so.  
罗宾：乍一看，似乎如此。

Barbara: What do you mean?  
芭芭拉：你的意思是什么？

Robin: Actually, there are a lot of dangers in this. It's all about the U.S. trying to `save face`.  
罗宾：其实这里面有很多危险，都是美国`为了面子`。

Barbara: Why do you think so?  
芭芭拉：你为什么这么认为？

Robin: America has made a greater `financial commitment`, you know. President George W. Bush has `proposed` putting $1.7 billion in fuel-cell research over the next five years, while Europe is spending only around 150 million a year.  
罗宾：你知道，美国做出了更大的`财政承诺`。乔治·W·布什总统`提议`在未来五年内投入 17 亿美元用于燃料电池研究，而欧洲每年的投入仅为 1.5 亿美元左右。

Barbara: But does it have anything to do with the progress of the project?  
芭芭拉：但是这和项目的进展有关系吗？

Robin: Anything? Everything, in fact. With such a big `investment`, the United States is likely to `dominate` the research. The technology's development will be seriously affected.  
罗宾：什么都做？事实上是一切。如此大的`投资`，美国很可能在研究中`占据主导地位`。该技术的发展将受到严重影响。

Barbara: Does it make any difference whether the research efforts are U.S.led or Europe-led?  
芭芭拉：研究工作是由美国主导还是由欧洲主导，有什么区别吗？

Robin: Fuel cells create electricity by combining oxygen and hydrogen without producing `harmful emissions`, and technical construction poses few basic challenges.  
罗宾：燃料电池通过结合氧气和氢气来发电，不会产生`有害排放`，而且技术构造几乎没有什么基本挑战。  
But opinion is `sharply divided` over how to `obtain` hydrogen without `wasting` more natural resources. `Isolating` hydrogen can take plenty of energy, and Europe favors a green `approach`.  
但对于如何在不`浪费`更多自然资源的情况下`获取`氢气，人们的看法存在`很大分歧`。`分离`氢气需要大量能源，欧洲倾向于采用绿色`方法`。  
That means making use of `renewable resources` for the task, say `wind and solar resources`. By contrast, the United States `appears` more than willing to use supplies of fossil fuels, such as coal or natural gas. What's more, it also favors employing `nuclear` power.  
这意味着要利用`可再生资源`来完成这项任务，比如`风能和太阳能`。相比之下，美国`似乎`更愿意使用化石燃料，如煤炭或天然气。此外，它还倾向于使用`核`能。

Barbara: Do you mean the Americans have the final say in making a choice?  
芭芭拉：你的意思是美国人有最终决定权吗？

Robin: Absolutely. `Money earns the right to choose`.  
罗宾：当然了。`有钱才能有选择权`。

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Listen to the following news about a dispute over the effects of the 9/11 incident on the environment.  
请听以下有关“9/11”事件对环境的影响的争议的新闻。

Christine Todd Whitman, the former head of the U.S. `Environmental Protection Agency`, is in the hot seat over her role in the downplaying of the health dangers for New York City residents after 9/11.  
美国`环境保护署`前署长克里斯汀·托德·惠特曼因在“9·11”事件后淡化纽约市居民的健康风险而陷入困境。  
A report by the EPA `inspector general` says Whitman assured the public that the air was safe before `testing was conclusive`. In addition, all EPA statements were required to be `screened` by the White House.  
美国环保署`监察长`的报告称，惠特曼在`检测结果出来`之前就向公众保证空气是安全的。此外，所有环保署声明都必须经过白宫的`审查`。

The `long-term` effect of breathing in air polluted with chemicals is unknown.  
吸入受化学物质污染的空气的`长期`影响尚不清楚。
But New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler `accuses` the administration of covering up a `potential` health danger in order to get the economy up and running. "Many people will die early because of this," says Nadler.  
但纽约州众议员杰罗德·纳德勒`指责`政府为了推动经济发展而掩盖`潜在的`健康危害。“许多人会因此而早逝，”纳德勒说。

Whitman says that she did not object when the White House edited out cautionary notes by EPA scientists.  
惠特曼说，当白宫删除环保局科学家的警告时，她没有反对。  
She believes that much of the data were open to interpretation, and the White House appropriately reached for the more reassuring analysis.  
她认为，许多数据都有待解释，白宫采取更令人放心的分析是恰当的。  
But New York Sen. Hillary Clinton is calling for an investigation, saying somebody surely leaned on the EPA to lie, which Whitman strongly denies.  
但纽约州参议员希拉里·克林顿呼吁展开调查，称肯定有人依靠环保局撒谎，惠特曼对此予以坚决否认。

## Passage

When it comes to air pollution, the simple life isn't `necessarily` the safest. The most `poisonous` atmosphere in Asia is found not in `rapidly modernizing cities` like New Delhi or Beijing but inside the kitchens of homes in `rural` Asia. Millions of families in the countryside heat their `abodes and cook` with open fires, using cheap fuels that `belch carbon monoxide` and other `noxious fumes` at levels up to 500 times international safety limits.  
说到空气污染，简单的生活不`一定`是最安全的。亚洲最`有毒的`空气不是在新德里或北京等`快速现代化的城市`，而是在亚洲`农村`家庭的厨房里。农村的数百万家庭用明火`取暖和做饭`，使用廉价燃料，`排放的一氧化碳`和其他`有毒气体`的浓度高达国际安全限值的 500 倍。  
Rural women and children often spend hours each day in poorly ventilated kitchens, breathing this putrid air. “This is a problem that has been around forever, as long as humankind has existed, but it's been ignored," says Eva Rehfuess, a World Health Organization expert on indoor air pollution. “If you walked into these kitchens, your eyes would start tearing and you would find it difficult to breathe. It's terrible.”  
农村妇女和儿童每天经常在通风不良的厨房里呆上几个小时，呼吸着这种腐臭的空气。“这个问题自人类存在以来就一直存在，但却被忽视了，”世界卫生组织室内空气污染专家伊娃·雷福斯说。“如果你走进这些厨房，你的眼睛就会开始流泪，呼吸也会变得困难。这太可怕了。”

The WHO estimates that indoor air pollution causes 1.6 million deaths per year in developing countries around the world, up to 550,000 of which occur in India alone - and overwhelmingly it's the poor who are dying. Villagers have no choice but to use wood, coal or dung fires, raising the risk that young children will be killed by carbon-monoxide poisoning or a bad case of pneumonia ravaging weakened lungs. Likewise, the women who typically keep their home fires burning are vulnerable to chronic respiratory diseases. "Day in and day out for 50 years, some of these women might be cooking six hours a day, exposed to pollutants," says Rehfuess.  
世界卫生组织估计，室内空气污染每年在全球发展中国家造成 160 万人死亡，其中仅印度就有 55 万人死亡，而绝大多数死亡者都是穷人。村民别无选择，只能使用木柴、煤炭或粪火，这增加了幼儿因一氧化碳中毒或肺部受损而患上严重肺炎的风险。同样，通常让家里的炉火继续燃烧的妇女容易患上慢性呼吸道疾病。“这些妇女中有些人可能每天要做饭六个小时，每天要暴露在污染物中，50 年如一日，”雷福斯说。

Curtailing indoor air pollution can be as simple as replacing open wood fires with better-ventilated cookstoves, but more sophisticated stoves cost up to $120. China and India, home to the world's largest rural populations, have launched ambitious national programs in recent decades to supply villagers with safer stoves at subsidized prices. But the programs have not always worked, in India, for example, some 33 million stoves were given out free to villagers in rural areas from 1984 to 2000 - but because of a lack of health education or follow-up maintenance, most families abandoned the cookstoves for their old fires within a few years.  
减少室内空气污染很简单，只需用通风更好的炉灶代替明火即可，但更先进的炉灶价格高达 120 美元。中国和印度是世界上农村人口最多的国家，近几十年来，这两个国家推出了雄心勃勃的国家计划，以补贴价格向村民提供更安全的炉灶。但这些计划并不总是奏效，例如在印度，从 1984 年到 2000 年，印度向农村地区的村民免费发放了约 3300 万个炉灶，但由于缺乏健康教育或后续维护，大多数家庭在几年内就放弃了炉灶，改用旧炉灶。

That's left nongovernmental organizations like the Shell Foundation to step into the gap. It has begun a pilot program with local Indian NGOs in a pair of rural states to develop and market clean, wood-burning stoves that cost just $5-$10 yet can reduce emissions by up to 40%. The project is on track to sell 100,000 stoves by the end of 2005, and the groups plan to expand the program nationally in the future. Program manager Karen Westley says Shell and its partner NGOs made an effort to sell their customers not just more efficient tools but also the idea that different is better. "You have to make sure that people actually want that damn thing," says Westley. "They need to make the connection between having a better stove, breathing less smoke and experiencing better health in the end."  
这就需要壳牌基金会等非政府组织来填补这一空白。该基金会已与印度两个农村地区的当地非政府组织合作开展了一项试点项目，旨在开发和销售清洁的燃木炉，这种炉子只需 5 至 10 美元，但可以减少高达 40% 的排放量。该项目有望在 2005 年底前销售 10 万台炉子，这些组织计划在未来将该项目扩展到全国。项目经理凯伦·韦斯特利说，壳牌及其合作非政府组织不仅努力向客户推销更高效的工具，还努力向客户推销与众不同就是更好的理念。“你必须确保人们真的想要那个该死的东西，”韦斯特利说。“他们需要将拥有更好的炉子、减少烟雾和最终获得更好的健康联系起来。”

But habits ingrained through tradition can be hard to break."They've been living with this always, and so have their mothers and grandmothers," says Rehfuess. "You have to give people the feeling they can do something about it." And that they'll breathe a lot easier for their trouble.
但传统中根深蒂固的习惯很难改变。“他们一直生活在这种环境中，他们的母亲和祖母也是如此，”雷福斯说。“你必须让人们感觉到他们可以做些什么。”这样他们就能因为自己的麻烦而松一口气。

### Section III Reading Comprehension

Read the following texts. Answer the questions by choosing A, B, C or D.

#### 1

People all over the world today are beginning to hear and learn more and more about the problem of pollution. Pollution is caused either by man's release of completely new and often artificial substances into the environment or by releasing greatly increased amounts of a natural substance, such as oil from oil tankers into the sea.

The whole industrial process which makes many of the goods and machines we need and use in our daily lives, is bound to create a number of waste products which upset the environmental balance. Many of these waste products can be prevented or disposed of sensibly, but clearly while more and more new and complex goods are produced there will be new, dangerous wastes to be disposed of, for example, the waste products from nuclear power stations. Many people, therefore, see pollution as only part of a larger and more complex problem, that is, the whole process of industrial production and consumption of goods. Others again see the problem mainly in connection with agriculture, where new methods are helping farmers grow more and more on their land to feed our ever-increasing populations. However, the land itself is gradually becoming worn out as it is being used, in some cases, too heavily, and artificial fertilizers cannot restore the balance.

Whatever its underlying reasons, there is no doubt that much of the pollution caused could be controlled if only companies, individuals and governments would make more efforts. In the home there is an obvious need to control litter and waste. Food comes wrapped up three or four times in packages that all have to be disposed of; drinks are increasingly sold in bottles or tins which cannot be reused. These not only cause a litter problem, but also are a great waste of resources, in terms of glass, metals and paper. Advertising has helped this process by persuading many of us not only to buy things we neither want nor need, but also to throw away much of what we do buy. Pollution and waste combine to be a problem everyone can help solve by cutting out unnecessary buying, excess consumption and careless disposal of the products we use in our daily lives.

#### 2

Every year there are changes in climate in diferent parts of the world. Some of these changes are due to natural causes. However, some climate changes are caused by air pollution and these changes may increase.

If the pollution affects the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the results are likely to be serious. Carbon dioxide constitutes only a small part of the atmosphere. But it has an important function in maintaining the balance between radiation from the sun entering the atmosphere and radiation leaving the earth. Some of the radiation is absorbed by the earth and some is radiated back into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere prevents some of the radiation from leaving the atmosphere. Thus the heat remains in the atmosphere and carbon dioxide helps prevent the temperature of the earth from falling.

If the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increased as a result of air pollution, the temperature of the atmosphere may rise. This might eventually cause the ice in the North and South Poles to melt. If this happened, the sea level could rise and parts of the earth would be flooded. The likelihood of this happening is remote, but the possibility exists.

There is also a fairly strong possibility that the dust level in the atmosphere will rise as a result of industrial pollution. This dust pollution will reflect sunlight back into space. If this happens less sunlight will reach the earth and the temperature will fall.

Another danger comes from the destruction of the earth's vegetation such as the forests of Brazil, which are being cleared away for farmland and cities. Trees use carbon dioxide and their destruction may upset the balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."
