# Travel and Tourism

## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Two young people, an American and a Japanese, are chatting as they wait to board their flight.

M: I see by your boarding card that we're on the same flight.
W: Oh, really? I'm so happy to meet someone else on my flight - this is my first trip overseas.
M: Then you've never been to the United States. Are you going there to study or just for sightseeing?
W: I'll be studying tourism management for two years at a private institute for foreigners.
M: That's great. Oh, by the way, I'm John Smith. I'm returning home to New York City after a two-week vacation here in Tokyo.
W: Was it your first trip to Japan?
M: Oh, no, I've been here three times. I have friends living in Tokyo.
W: Speaking of friends, I think I'd better find the tax-free shop before we board the plane. I'd like to buy some gifts for the people who will be meeting me at the airport.
M: The shop is over there in the corner - I'l watch your things for you while you look around.
W: Thanks, I'd appreciate that. Do Ihave much time?
M: Yes, I just looked at the board - they should be announcing our flight in about 30 minutes.

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Edmund,a tourist,is taking a trip in North America.He wants to know more about culture and life there. Now he is talking with Deborah, a tourist guide,about restaurants in the U.S.

Edmund: Hello, Deborah, could you kindly tell me what kind of restaurants I can find in America?
Deborah: You can find many kinds of restaurants offering a wide selection of foods at a variety of prices with a variety of services. Basically, however, restaurants can be classified into two types-fast food and full service.
Edmund: What is fast food restaurant? And what kind of food do they offer?
Deborah: Fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and so forth, serve hamburgers, tacos, chicken, sandwiches, and other foods that usually cost less than $3 per item.
Edmund: That is the same case in China. But I saw in western movies that people could order and pick up food without leaving their cars.
Deborah: Of course you could do that in America. That is called "drive-through-window" service. If you want to eat in the restaurant, you then seat yourself. You are also expected to clean off your table when you are done with the meal.
Edmund: How about the full service restaurants? Are there many differences between fast food and full service restaurants?
Deborah: Full-service restaurants offer even a wider variety, usually at higher prices. Unlike fast-food restaurants, they usually seat you, have a waiter or waitress take your order and serve your food, and clean your table after you complete your meal.
Edmund: Do I have to make reservations?
Deborah: Most restaurants do not require you to make reservations. However, if you are not sure whether reservations are required, call the restaurant and ask.
Edmund: Do I need to "tip"?
Deborah: Generally speaking, a tip is expected at any restaurant where a waiter or waitress serves you. The acceptable standard is 15% of the total bill. Some restaurants will automatically add this 15%, called a "gratuity charge", to your bill if you have a certain number of people in your party.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Employees in ABO, an international automobile company, are required to travel a lot around the world. Stephen, an experienced senior manager of the firm, is now delivering a lecture to new recruits about travel affairs.

Many people are really upset when their flight is delayed. Not only do they have to postpone their plans but, even worse, they have to wait in an airport! There is no need to be upset though. Airports are much better places these days than most people realize. It is believed that airport food is bad — as bad as airplane food. As a matter of fact, airports have fine international cuisine — from fresh seafood in New York to Brazilian barbecue in Hong Kong. And you can stock up on something to have for later — for example, cheese and caviar in Mexico City. People might think that airports could make people uncomfortable and tense. Actually that's not the truth. If you are stuck in an airport, you could have some fun. As far as I know, for instance, the airport at Honolulu has peaceful gardens. Pittsburgh has a meditation room. When you walk in, relaxing music comes and pictures of clouds are projected on the wall. If you prefer exercise, hotels at the airports in San Francisco, Rome, and many other cities have fitness centers that anyone can use.
And shopping in airports is great if you would like to buy something fancy and rare. In Paris, you can buy anything from perfume to diamonds. In Nogales, Arizona, you can buy antique knives or regional art. The art is so interesting that some people fly to Nogales just to visit the airport galery. And Hong Kong's airport is known for some of the best shopping in the world.

## Passage

To attract tourism to one's country was once thought of as an unqualified success; there seemed to be no negative aspects to it. However, today we are coming to realize that tourism is a mixed blessing; it has advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, it can bring money to parts of the world that very much need it. People can earn a great deal through tourism. And this income can help to preserve the environment. Anything that helps to protect the ecosystem, the interrelated community of plants and animals that makes up the earth, is, of course, positive.
A recent worry, however, is the fact that tourists can cause serious damage to the fragile environments they love to visit. Ecosystems are delicate and easily damaged. Around the world, areas are endangered by the large numbers of tourists who visit them. On every continent, tourism threatens the environment. Even trekkers who take difficult journeys on foot can cause damage. There are, then, serious dangers that come with the promise of tourism Every advantage brings with it real disadvantages. This dilemma makesplanning difficult for nations trying to decide what to do. Countries can makea good deal more money from the tourist industry than they need to put intoattracting tourists. This financial profit can help nations protect habitatswhere endangered animals and plants live. It also may be that tourism canhelp strengthen local cultures by encouraging awareness of traditions andceremonies. Historic buildings thrive on tourism. These cultural locations enjoygreat success with the money and respect brought by tourism.But there is a downside to all this. Because cultural sites are becomingtoo crowded, Disneyland-like reproductions are being created. These are notauthentic cultural sites but copies of something that may or may not have everreally existed. Some people say, "What's the value of tradition if it's kept alivefor profit, and bears little relation to real life?"Taken together, the negative effects of tourism grow larger over time.The cumulative effects of tourism are great because every time we use cars orplanes to travel we contribute to one of the greatest disruptions in the historyof the planet: global warming and climate change are interrupting what hasbeen the normal climate pattern for centuries.New approaches to the problem are also being developed. One initiativehas been the development of tourist opportunities in which the tourists bothgive and receive through working vacations. This kind of personal, small-scaletourism is meant to be a positive response to the kind of industrializationof tourism that has become typical with its large-scale organizing. Workingtourism may not be for everyone, but the hope is that some kinds of travel canbecome more planet friendly.
