William Smith, who is from the U.S., is making arrangements at a travel agency for a sightseeing tour in London.

Agent: Good morning, sir. May I help you?
Smith: Yes, I'd like to take a one-day sightseeing tour around London. Do you have any available?
Agent: Yes, we have several. Here are the brochures that describe them.
Smith: I particularly want to visit the British Museum and the Tower of London. Do you have any tours that include both of them?

Smith: How long does the tour take?
Agent: About seven hours. How large is your party, by the way?
Smith: There are six people in my party.
Agent: Where are you staying?
Smith: At the Hyde Park Hotel.
Agent: Let's see, the bus stops there at 10:00. You should be back by 5:00 in the afternoon.

Agent: It's $15, including lunch.

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

A tourist is making arrangements at a travel agency for a half-day tour around San Francisco.

Agent: Good afternoon sir, can I help you?
Tourist: Yes, I'd like to take a half-day tour around San Francisco. What do you have available?
Agent: Well, we have two half-day tours daily- one in the morning from 9:30 to 12:30 and another four-hour tour in the afternoon, starting at 1:30.
Tourist: There are two places I really want to see- one is Fisherman's Wharf and the other is Golden Gate Park.
Agent: The morning tour does include a stop at Fisherman's Wharf-but I'm afraid our tours don't include the park. You might enjoy going there on your own.
Tourist: That might be a good idea. Well, I guess I'll sign up for tomorrow morning's tour, anyway. Is there still room?
Agent: Yes, there is. Will this be for yourself only?
Tourist: No, my wife and two children will also be going. The name is Peter Stone. What is the fee, by the way?
Agent: For adults, $10. Children under 12 go for half price, and children under three are free.
Tourist: My children are both under 12.
Agent: That'll come to $30 plus tax.
Tourist: There you are. See you tomorrow!
Agent: Just a minute. Here are your tickets. And here's some information about the tour.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Mrs. Smith is talking with a travel consultant about her extended family tour near her hometown.

Mrs. Smith: It is just my husband and I now, but we have grown-up children who are married and 6 grandchildren. We'd like to go away together for some time, you know, we don't see much of each other now.
Consultant: I agree with you. Building a tradition of the extended family all going away together is a great way to build long-lasting family bonds. Almost ten years ago my own family started going camping together once a week each year, and now everyone looks forward to this trip.
Mrs. Smith: But, it can be very expensive, isn't it?
Consultant: It may not be your opinion, but the destination, and least of all the cost, Don't you think so?
Mrs. Smith: Well, certainly you are right. But we're a big family. The number of people determines the amount of travel costs. We will hope we can keep that down. Do you have any good suggestions?
Consultant: The most expensive part of most trips is transportation. If you would like to stay within a hundred miles of home, and that should keep your costs down.
Mrs. Smith: Yes, that's what we just planned. How about accommodations and food?
Consultant: You may go by camping. No doubt, it is the best way to cut down on hotel costs and food costs. And camp is a terriffic way to build memories and togetherness, which is what I suspect you are trying to do.
Mrs. Smith: It seems good, but I hear that camping is no so convenient or interesting. There is no need to worry about that. Nowadays, many commercial campgrounds are quite plush, with swimming pools, hot tubs, game rooms, etc., and a number of campgrounds will not out travel trailers, cabins or lodges if you prefer a real bed instead of a sleeping bag. That's perfect. I will try to look for a site like this near my home. Thank you very much.
