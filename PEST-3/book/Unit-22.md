## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Zhang Jun, a young Chinese student of 22, is now `pursuing` his `Ph.D. of law` at the University of Arizona, U.S.A.  
22 岁的中国留学生张俊正在美国亚利桑那大学攻读法学博士学位。  
Though he has stayed in Tucson for a couple of weeks, he is still `puzzled` about the mailing service in America. So he's now turning to Mary, his fellow student yet `a native American`, for help.  
虽然他已经在图森呆了几个星期，但他对美国的邮寄服务仍然感到困惑。于是他向他的同学、`土生土长的美国人`玛丽求助。

Zhang Jun: Well, Mary, I'm `desperately in need` of your help. I haven't sent letters to my parents for nearly a month since I arrived here in Tucson. I'm afraid they will be worried about me. Could you please tell me where I can mail letters?  
张军：玛丽，我`非常需要`你的帮助。自从我来到图森，我已经将近一个月没有给父母寄信了。我担心他们会担心我。你能告诉我在哪里可以寄信吗？

Mary: You know every city in the United States has at least one post office where you can buy stamps and mail packages and letters. The postal service also places public `mailboxes` on `various` street corners. You can also find places for outgoing mail just outside your dormitory.  
玛丽：你知道，美国每个城市至少有一个邮局，你可以在那里买邮票、邮寄包裹和信件。邮政服务还在各个街角设置了公共`邮箱`。你也可以在宿舍外面找到寄出邮件的地方。

Zhang Jun: But how do I mail letters for `overseas` destinations?  
张俊：可是，我该如何寄送`海外`的信件呢？

Mary: First of all, you should check with the post office for current overseas airmail `rates`. Make sure you always clearly mark "airmail" on the `envelope`. Using self-folding airmail forms, called "aerogrammes", can save you money on `postage`.  
玛丽：首先，你应该向邮局查询当前的海外航空邮件`费率`。一定要在`信封`上清楚地标明“航空邮件”。使用自动折叠的航空邮件表格（称为“航空信”）可以节省`邮费`。

Zhang Jun: Sounds not very troublesome. That is a great relief to me. How can I mail packages?  
张俊：听起来不是很麻烦。这对我来说是很大的安慰。我怎样才能邮寄包裹呢？

Mary: A post office clerk can explain the various rates for mailing packages within United States or overseas. Within the United States, packages can often be sent `cheaper and faster` using independent package and delivery services, such as United Parcel Service, UPS.  
邮局工作人员可以解释在美国境内或海外邮寄包裹的各种费率。在美国境内，使用独立包裹和快递服务（例如联合包裹服务公司 (UPS)）通常可以`更便宜、更快速`地寄送包裹。

Zhang Jun: I will probably move around a lot while I'm in the United States. How do I `obtain` a permanent address?  
张俊：我在美国可能会经常搬家。我怎样才能`获得`永久地址呢？

Mary: For a small fee, you can rent a box, called a post office box or "P.O. Box", at your campus post office. When you give someone your `permanent address`, use the box number, city, state, and zip code.  
玛丽：只需支付少量费用，您就可以在校园邮局租用一个信箱，称为邮政信箱或“P.O. Box”。当您向某人提供您的`永久地址`时，请使用信箱号、城市、州和邮政编码。

Zhang Jun: Thanks a lot.  
张俊：谢谢。

Mary: My pleasure!"  
玛丽：我非常荣幸！”

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

If you want to get something done quickly, it's a good idea to spend some time `getting the proper information` first. If you don't, you'll generally spend more time doing it in the end. With pay telephone calls, you may spend more money, too. Adam's story is an example.  
如果你想快速完成某件事，最好先花点时间获取正确的信息。如果你不这样做，你最终通常会花更多的时间去做这件事。打付费电话，你也可能会花更多的钱。亚当的故事就是一个例子。

Adam is a sophomore at `Tsinghua University`, majoring in civil engineering. His girl friend Rebecca goes to Beijing Institute of International Relations and studies accounting.  
Adam 是`清华大学`土木工程专业的大二学生，他的女朋友 Rebecca 就读于北京国际关系学院，主修会计专业。

On Thursday night, Adam tried to make a phone call to Rebecca about their date for the weekend.  
周四晚上，亚当试图给丽贝卡打电话，商量周末的约会事宜。

When Adam met Rebecca three months ago, he wrote her telephone number on the back of his `calculus` notebook. He never memorized it because he almost always carries the notebook with him. But Thursday night he didn't have the notebook with him.  
三个月前，亚当遇见丽贝卡时，把她的电话号码写在了`微积分`笔记本的背面。他从来没记住过，因为他几乎总是随身带着笔记本。但周四晚上，他却没有带笔记本。

He went to the public telephone booth and called the general telephone number of the institute where Rebecca studies. The night operator at the institute didn't have a list of students and their numbers. She told him to try the dormitory and gave him the number.  
他来到公用电话亭，拨通了丽贝卡所在学院的总机，学院的夜班接线员没有学生名单和电话号码。她让他去宿舍试试，并给了他宿舍号码。

But Adam accidentally dialed the wrong number and woke up an old lady, who threatened to call the police. Adam carefully dialed the number again, this time correctly, but it was the men's dormitory. The guy who answered gave Adam another number to call.  
但亚当不小心拨错了号码，吵醒了一位老太太，她扬言要报警。亚当小心翼翼地再次拨了号码，这次拨对了，但拨的是男生宿舍的号码。接电话的人给了亚当另一个号码。

Adam dialed this number, and a girl answered.He asked to speak toRebecca, but the girl said, 'Rebecca lives in the dorm, but not on this floor.This is the third floor, and she lives on the eighth.' After a delay, she wasable to find the number for the eighth floor. He dialed this number.  
亚当拨通了这个号码，接电话的是一个女孩。他想和丽贝卡通话，但女孩说：“丽贝卡住在宿舍，但不在这层楼。这是三楼，她住在八楼。”过了一会儿，她终于找到了八楼的号码。他拨通了这个号码。

Another girl answered the telephone. Adam again asked to speak toRebecca, and the girl yelled, 'Just a minute . Hey, Rebecca! It's for you!'Five minutes went by. Then someone hung the phone up. He impatientlydialed the number again, and this time Rebecca finally answered.  
另一个女孩接了电话。亚当再次要求和丽贝卡通话，女孩喊道：“等一下。嘿，丽贝卡！找你！”五分钟过去了。然后有人挂断了电话。他不耐烦地再次拨了号码，这一次丽贝卡终于接了电话。

Adam spent two yuan for the call that night!  
亚当那天晚上的通话费是两元！
