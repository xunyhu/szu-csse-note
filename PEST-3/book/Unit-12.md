Zheng Dong is talking with his classmate Mary, who came to Guangzhou weeksago, about some famous stores in Guangzhou.

Zheng: What a sunny day today, Mary! Would you like to make some purchase?
Mary: Good idea. But I am afraid I still know little about stores in Guangzhou.
Zheng: Oh, they are really fascinating. Let me introduce some of them to you. Er.. have you heard about the famous Guangzhou Dongshan Department Store?
Mary: Is it a very large modern one?
Zheng: Yes. It has a shopping area of 5,000 square meters, selling 80,000 varieties of goods. Besides, it carries out a modern management system and operates with flexibility to suit the market. So it's the only department store in Guangdong that has won the title of 'Advanced Company' at the national level and many awards at the provincial and municipal level for its service and sales volume.
Mary: That's quite impressive.
Zheng: Let me tell you another big one - Tianmao Nanfang Department Store.
Mary: Oh, I think I passed by this store last week. It is really grand.
Zheng: It has become a rising star in the business sector of Guangzhou.
Mary: I shall visit it some day. Last time I even didn't enter it, but I have been really attracted by its magnificent appearance.
Zheng: Yes. It always boasts that. By the way, do you know Wangfujing Department Store?
Mary: Isn't it in Beijing?
Zheng: There is also one in Guangzhou. It was invested and established by the mother company in Beijing. Now, it is the largest retailing department store in Guangzhou. It not only promotes local prosperity, but also helps with the economic and cultural exchanges between the north and the south.
Mary: I see, just like a bridge.
Zheng: Quite right. It serves as a bridge for southern goods to enter northern markets and vice versa.
Mary: These stores are truly fascinating. I will surely go to make some purchases there. Will you accompany me then?
Zheng: Yes, I certainly will.

Jack is asking Joan for some advice about shopping.

Joan: As I was telling you,Jack,where you shop depends largely on what you need. So, if you want to buy an answering machine or a CD-player, your best bet would probably be an appliance store such as Circuit City.
Jack:Yup! Or Best Buy.
Joan: I like Copper Cement the best, though.
Jack: Why? That strange named shop!
Joan: Because they usually have the best deals. They have sales on theirTVs and CD-players every once in a while.
Jack: Well,I stil think the CD-player I bought from them was a rip off.
Joan: I'll admit some of their items are high-priced, but at least theshopper's guaranteed quality. There are very few places that havesuch a wide selection.
Jack: I need to buy disks, at least two disk holders, cassettes,transparencies, erasers, and that kind of stuff.
Joan: For office supplies, I suggest Office Max or Office Dealer.
Jack: But they are far away from the campus.
Joan: I know, you can easily get what you want at any of the smallbookstores. That is one good thing about living on campus. But nodoubt small shops often do overcharge.
Jack: I will try to get around that by shopping around.Joan:Shopping around?
Jack: Yes. It simply means you go to different stores, check out the pricesof items you need and purchase them from the stores with thelowest prices.
Joan: I see. Sounds very practical.
Jack: And time-consuming, too!"

To purchase beads there are many alternatives in the " way to shop for them. Beads are available as a single bead or as part of a jewelry item. Popular jewelry items include necklaces, bracelets and caps.

Firstly, bead shops are available in shopping mals. This is possibly the cheapest means of purchasing a single bead. The stores wil purchase a large amount of each type and size of bead at a lower price from wholesale and then pass on part of the savings to the customer. This form of bead shopping wil enable the purchaser to buy as many single beads as are required in order to make a personal item of jewelry or other beaded item. Shopping malls very often sel every type of bead imaginable. The types of beads include seed beads, crystal beads, glass beads, lamp work beads and silver beads, etc. Shopping malls also sel beaded jewelry items at reasonable prices. These items may be fashionable, off purchases or of unusual requirements.

Secondly, specific outlets are also an option when one purchases beads. Swarovski is the most popular outlet of crystal beads. Therefore many customers may prefer to deal directly with that specific supplier. This will ensure that the crystal beads are genuine and possibly offering the most choice. Specific outlets may be more expensive because of the brand names that are usually attached. This is also the case when considering the purchase of jewelry items from specific outlets.

Thirdly, catalogues are a hassle free means of purchasing beads and beaded items.
