# Hobbies and Interests

## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Jack is a local reporter and he is interviewing students on campus about their hobbies. Sandy is one of the students being interviewed.

Jack: Hi, I am Jack from the local newspaper. I am conducting interviews on the subject of hobbies of students. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Sandy: No problem. What would you like to know about?
Jack: What kind of entertainment do you like?
Sandy: I love going to concerts. I don't go frequently because they are a bit beyond my budget. I am not earning any money right now, so it is hard for me to afford them.
Jack: Then how do you normally spend your spare time?
Sandy: I enjoy outdoor activities. When I am free, I climb mountains with my friends. The closest one is not far from our school, just 30 minutes by bus. Bus No. 3 takes us directly to the foot of the mountain. I am really into nature and I love being around trees and water and mountain as much as possible.
Jack: What else do you do besides that in your spare time?
Sandy: What else? Well, I collect stamps as well. You can sometimes learn a lot from your collection. Some stamps tell you stories.
Jack: When did you start to collect stamps?"
Sandy: I started doing that at the age of 5. One day, my mother showed me her small but wonderful collection and told me about the stamps one by one. Then I became interested. Now I have even got a couple of rare stamps.
Jack: Great. You have answered all my questions! Thank you for your time!

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Dave and Nancy are drinking at a bar. They are talking about TV programs they enjoy.

Dave: Hi, Nancy.
Nancy: Hey, Dave. How was your weekend?
Dave: It was great. I worked really hard in the daytime and then watched TV overnight. Right now watching TV is the only hobby I have.
Nancy: Did you watch the basketball game yesterday?
Dave: Of course! You think that I would miss that? The remarkable Chicago Bull presented a striking contrast to its opponent, and the crowd just went wild! Sports are always my favorite things. Later my mother changed to Channel 5, so I sat down and watched a movie with her. I don't even remember the name of the movie.
Nancy: I cannot take too much TV. For me, it is a waste of time unless you can gain something through it. But sometimes the quiz shows are really interesting. I watch Happy Dictionary occasionally. It is a weekly one-hour quiz show. Each time they invite about 6 guests to participate as well as a group of spectators to watch the show. The chosen examinee has to answer up to 12 questions and get a prize according to the number of questions he or she answers correctly. You can really enlarge your range of general knowledge by watching it.
Dave: I watched that a couple of times. It was fun. Believe or not, I also enjoy cartoons. They are really relaxing and sometimes quite educational as well. What is on tonight? Let me check the paper. Where is the TV guide?
Nancy: Here it is. Oh, Growing Pains is on again! Situation comedies are becoming more and more popular. My sister grew up watching that show.
Dave: Great. Let's go home and watch TV. I cannot live without it.

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Li Ming and Fred Lee met again in the dining hall. They are talking about their university lives.

Li Ming: Hey, Fred! Long time no see! How is everything?
Fred Lee: Great. How nice to see you again! It has been a month since we met at Sandy's birthday party. What have you been doing?
Li Ming: Well, I was studying hard for the exam last week. Finally I can take a moment to breathe. How about you? How do you spend your spare time? Maybe sometimes we can spend some time together.
Fred Lee: That will be fun. Hey, do you like playing badminton? I am still learning. I play badminton once a week in the university gym, each time for about two hours. If you are interested, I can book a court for this Tuesday.
Li Ming: Actually I am also a beginner. I would love to join, but my elbow has been hurting recently. Maybe it is better for me to wait for two weeks. What other pastimes do you have?
Fred Lee: I love skiing as well. I am a big sports fan. Sports can really get me away from a stressful day and exercise my brain.
Li Ming: I understand. I work out too to keep fit, otherwise my brain doesn't work properly.
Fred Lee: How much time do you spend on that?
Li Ming: Twice a week in the recreation center. Sometimes when I am in the mood, I play the violin for friends. I learned from a professional violinist two years ago.
Fred Lee: Maybe next time you can also invite me when you play.
Li Ming: Sure.

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Mary and Peter take the same course and they meet each other for the first time in class. They are talking about books they love.

Peter: I really enjoyed the class. The teacher knows how to teach effectively.
Mary: Yes. And the textbook is also interesting with lots of vivid illustrations.
Peter: I am glad that I decided to take the course. I don't think we've met before. I am Peter from New York.
Mary: I am Mary Smith. Nice to meet you!
Peter: Were you reading a novel just now? Sorry I interrupted you.
Mary: Well, it doesn't matter. I love reading books for fun whenever I have some free time. It is really relaxing especially after a stressful day.
Peter: What kind of books do you prefer?
Mary: Well, I am fascinated by books which are about feelings and emotions or are closely related to our everyday life. I benefit a lot from those books, which help me deal better with relationships with family, friends and people around me. Sometimes people just think in different ways. How about you?
Peter: Well, I don't spend much time on reading. If I read too much, I get weary. Anyway, the books Ilike are mostly poetry. They are brief sketches of human merriment and sorrows.
Mary: I see what you mean. Do you have a favorite book?
Peter: I can't think of a particular book right now. How about you?
Mary: There are several books I really enjoyed. One of them is called Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus written by John Gray, an American writer.
Peter: Yeah, I heard about it. The book basically gives advice about how to understand men and women and how to communicate better with each other, right?
Mary: Right. Its main idea is that men and women are from different planets, and we cannot assume that our way of communication is similar. In fact, our ways of thinking are quite different. Well, I've got to go. Nice talking to you!
Peter: See you. Bye!

## Passage

I love reading novels, especially those classics. My favorite writer is Jane Austen, the one who wrote _Pride and Prejudice_. When the BBC screened its latest adaptation of Jane Austen's novel _Pride and Prejudice_, it was watched by a record 18 milion British viewers. The series was then sold to 18 countries round the world, from America to Australia, from Iceland to Israel. There are Jane Austen fans in all corners of the globe, and even special Jane Austen discussion groups on the Internet.

Jane Austen never once traveled abroad in her lifetime and she hardly everleft the south of England. When she died a spinster in 1817, only four of her sixnovels had been published, all anonymously, and she earned a grand total of648.65 pounds from her books. Now, nearly 200 years later, sales of her novelsrival modern bestsellers, reaching 35,000 a week. There have been film andtelevision productions of not only Pride and Prejudice, but also Emma, Persuasion,and the Oscar-winning Sense and Sensibility. Her house in Chawton in Hampshireis visited by 200 people a day.

She was born in 1775, the seventh of eight children. Her father was theReverend George Austen. They were not wel off, and lived in a village. By thetime when she was 12, Jane was writing stories about heroines imprisoned inhaunted castles, being rescued by glamorous heroes. In Jane's own life therewere three romantic attachments. The first was a handsome Irish law studentcalled Tom Lefroy, who she met in 1795, but who had to return to Ireland ayear later. The second, in 1801, was a young man called Samuel Blackall, whoshe fell in love with when on holiday in Devon, but who tragically died suddenlysoon after. The third was a large young man called Harries whose proposal shebriefly accepted in 1802, "but he had nothing to recommend him but his size,"so she changed her mind.

In 1801 the family moved to Bath, where she was very unhappy. To makematters worse, in 1805 her father died, leaving his widow, Jane and her onlysister Cassandra, also unmarried, even poorer than before. For four years theyhad to move from house to house, often staying with relatives. Finally in 1809her brother Edward allowed them to live in a house on his estate in Chawton,only a few miles from Steventon where she had grown up. Here she was muchhappier, despite being the poor relation, dependent on charity. She not onlyrevised her earlier novels but was able to write new ones, using her experiencesto satirize and make fun of the social inequalities she saw around her. At last in1811, Sense and Sensibility was the first of her novels to be published.
