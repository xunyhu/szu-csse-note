## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Melanie Sanders brings out her photo album to show her new Egyptian friend, Layth, pictures of her family.  
Melanie 拿出了她的相册，想给她认识的新埃及朋友 Layth 展示她家人的照片。

Melanie: Oh, Layth, I'm sure you recognize Grandmother in this picture? She's in the blue dress.  
梅兰妮 (Méi Lán Ní) ：哦，莱思 (Lái sī)，这张照片你肯定认得出来吧？穿蓝色衣服的就是我祖母。

Layth: Sure, and who's that `holding` the hand of a boy?  
莱思：嗯，没错。那个牵着小男孩的人是谁？

Melanie: That's my older brother, Lester, with my nephew, Nicky, when he was two years old. My sister-in-law, Dorothy, is next to him but she's not smiling because she was angry with Lester. Lester always leaves her and goes out of town on business.
梅兰妮：那是我哥哥莱斯特 (Lài sī tè)，还有我两岁大的侄子尼基 (Ní Jī)。他旁边的是我嫂子多萝西 (Duō Luó Xī)，但她看起来并不开心，因为她生我哥哥的气。莱斯特总是丢下她，外出谈生意。

Layth: I like this picture. It's so funny!
莱思：我喜欢这张照片，太有趣了！

Melanie: Oh, it's my niece, Nicole, when she was thirteen, I remeber. She was upset because Chris took her picture while she was curling her hair. You'll probably find this one funny, too. This is my great aunt, Anna Lawrence, Grandma's sister. Her hat is really out of date.
梅兰妮：哦，这是我侄女妮可 (Ní Kě) 十三岁的时候。当时克里斯 (Kè Lǐ sī) 偷拍了她烫头发的照片，她很生气，所以你可能会觉得这张照片也挺有趣。这位是安娜·劳伦斯 (Ān Nà Láo Lín sī)，我祖母的姐姐，我姑奶奶。她的帽子真的过时了。

Layth: Who's this skinny man?
莱思：这个瘦男人是谁？

Malanie: That's my great uncle, George Lawrence, Anna Lawrence's husband. You can tell they lived during the Depression. He's wearing boots because shoes were out of stock.
梅兰妮：那是我的叔叔，乔治·劳伦斯 (Qiáo Zhì Láo Lín sī)，安娜·劳伦斯的丈夫。他们肯定生活在大萧条时期，你看他穿的靴子，因为当时鞋子脱销了。

Layth: I can see they're definitely from the old generation.
莱思：我看得出他们绝对是老一代的人。

Malanie: Here's a more recent picture showing all three generations together. Here are Grandpa and Grandma Murphy, my mother's parents. And here are Mom and Dad, and here's my older brother, Lester, again with his wife and three of their children: Nicolas, Ryan, and Laura. Ryan really has an outgoing personality. See how he's smiling?
梅兰妮：这是一张较新的照片，展示了三代同堂。这是我外公外婆，墨菲爷爷奶奶 (Mò Fèi Yeye Nainai)。还有我爸爸妈妈，以及我哥哥莱斯特和他妻子和三个孩子：尼古拉斯 (Ní Gǔ Lā sī)、瑞恩 (Ruì Yèn) 和劳拉 (Láo Lā)。瑞恩性格真的外向，你看他笑得多开心？

Layth: Yes. He looks like he's fun to be with. You know what? I can see a strong family resemblance. Oh, who's this?
莱思：是的，他看起来很好相处。你知道吗？我能看到强烈的家族相似性。哦，这是谁？

Melanie: That's Curtis Lane, Lester's brother-in-law, his wife's brother. You ought to meet this man. He really knows how to bring a person out. I wish I had his social skills.  
梅兰妮：那是柯蒂斯·莱恩 (Kē dì sī · lái èn)，莱斯特的连襟，他妻子的弟弟。你应该认识他，他很擅长调动气氛，我希望我也有他的社交能力。

Layth: Who's this lady with Curtis Lane?
莱思：和柯蒂斯·莱恩在一起的这位女士是谁？

Melanie: That's his and Dorothy's mother, Lester's `mother-in-law`, Mrs.Lane.  
梅兰妮：那是他和多萝西的母亲，莱斯特的`岳母`，莱恩夫人 (Lái èn Fū Rén)。

Layth: Dose Mrs.Lane live with Lester and Dorothy?
莱思：莱恩夫人和莱斯特和多萝西住在一起吗？

Melanie: Oh, no! Lester always said he would never live with his in-laws. Well, Layth, since we've looked at all the pictures, would you like to go out and `stretch` your legs?  
梅兰妮：哦，不！莱斯特总是说他永远不会和岳父母住在一起。好了，莱思，既然我们看完了所有的照片，你想出去走动一下吗？

Layth: Okay! That's a good idea. But I enjoyed looking at the pictures.
莱思：好的！这主意不错。但我还是很喜欢看这些照片。

Naturally the staff of a model school should be representative in character.  
作为一个模范学校的教职员工，自然在性格方面应该具有代表性。  
Have you thought of which traits we should be looking for? I'd like to hear your suggestions.

Mr.lrving: Those are good qualities that we would want in every employee. Now, perhaps we should discuss virtues needed in a director. What do you want to tell me in this respect?  
伊尔文先生：这些是我们希望每个员工都具备的良好素质。现在，我们应该讨论一下一个主任需要具备的美德。你对此有什么要告诉我的吗？

Mr.Irving: Oh have you? What dis they say?  
伊尔文先生：哦，是吗？他们怎么说？

Mrs.Schmidt: According to them, a desirable director is humble, diplomatic, and flexible but well-educated and experienced. He should also be concerned, and even generous.  
施密特女士：据他们所说，一个理想的主任应该谦逊、圆通和灵活，但也应该受过良好教育并有经验。他还应该关心他人，甚至慷慨。

Mr.lrving: Absolutely! Now, would you address character description for the Commercial and Industrial Arts staff? You used to operate a vocational school, so your experience must have given you many ideas.  
伊尔文先生：绝对正确！现在，您能谈谈商贸和工业艺术类教师的性格描述吗？您以前经营过职业学校，所以您的经验一定给您提供了很多想法。

Mrs.Schmidt: In addition to those general assets, our school should seek practical leaders who are skillful and diligent. The best ones are also creative but modest, clever but humble.  
施密特女士：除了那些一般素质之外，我们学校还应该寻找实干型的领导者，他们应该技巧熟练、勤奋刻苦。最好的人选还富有创造力但谦虚谨慎，聪明能干但谦逊低调。

Mr.Irving: There are a number of other positions to consider. We have done good work so far. We can discuss the remaining items after lunch.  
伊尔文先生：还有许多其他职位需要考虑。到目前为止，我们已经做了很好的工作。剩下的部分我们可以午饭后讨论。

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Listen to the follwing monologue about Mary, a store detective.

Mary was an `eighteen-year-old` girl. She was only five feet tow inches tall and 105 pounds heavy. When she was offered a job of a store detective she felt surprised. The manager explained that they just needed persons like Mary for she didn't look like a detective. He said, "Most shoplifters are well-dressed, and many of them have much money and good jobs."  
玛丽今年 18 岁，身高只有五尺二英寸，体重 105 磅。当她被破格录用为商店侦探时，她感到非常惊讶。经理解释说，他们需要像玛丽这样的人，因为她看起来一点都不像侦探。他说：“大多数商店窃贼都衣着光鲜，许多人都有钱又有体面的工作。”

The manager was right. One morning, Mary saw someone who looked like a businessman standing at the tie counter. The salesclerk showed the man expensive silk ties. Then the clerk went to help another customer. As soon as the clerk turned around, the man put three ties in his `briefcase`. Two minutes later when the clerk turned, the man said, "I don't like these silk ties. They aren't of good quality."  
经理说得没错。一天早上，玛丽看到一个看起来像商界人士的男人站在领带柜台前。售货员向男人展示昂贵的丝绸领带。然后店员去帮助另一位顾客。店员刚一转身，那个男人就把三条领带放进了他的`公文包`。两分钟后，当店员转过身来时，男人说：“我不喜欢这些丝绸领带。质量太差了。”

The man walked as quickly as possible out of the front door. Mary followed him. When the man was about to step on a magnificent Rolls-Royce, Mary went up to him and said, "Excuse me, sir, would you mind letting me take a look in your briefcase?" The man was seized with terror but soon he calmed down and said, "`I'm afraid I certainly do mind`, if it's all the same to you. Now go away."  
那个男人尽可能快地走出了大门。玛丽跟着他。当男人正要踏进一辆华丽的劳斯莱斯轿车时，玛丽走上前去，对他说：“先生，打扰一下，请问您介意我看看您的公文包吗？” 那个男人惊恐万状，但很快镇定下来，说道：“`恐怕我真的很介意`，如果您无事的话，请走吧。”

Mary produced her identity card indicating that she was a store detective and she insisted on having a look into the man's briefcase. The man had no way out, saying, "Oh, very well. Anything to help a woman detective." Mary took out from the briefcase three silk ties. "Can you explain?" Mary asked. "Yes, nothing unusual in that," the man said. "I'll go to attend respectively a negotiation, a wedding and a funeral. I like to wear differently colored ties on different occasions."  
玛丽出示了她的身份证明，表明自己是商店侦探，并坚持要查看一下那个男人的公文包。那个男人别无选择，只好说：“好吧，为了帮助一位女侦探，没问题。” 玛丽从公文包里拿出了三条丝绸领带。“你能解释一下吗？” 玛丽问道。“没什么奇怪的，”那人说，“我分别要去参加谈判、婚礼和葬礼。我喜欢在不同的场合戴不同颜色的领带。”

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Jules Verne was not an inventor and he was not a scientist, but he read a great many scientific books.  
朱尔·凡尔讷既不是发明家，也不是科学家，但他博览群书，尤其热衷于科学著作。

He had a very strong imagination and he loved adventure although he did not have many great adventures himself.  
他拥有天马行空的想象力和一颗冒险的心，尽管现实生活中鲜有惊险经历。

He wrote a number of exciting books about the things which he thought that scientists and inventors would one day be able to do. At the time, his stories seemed like fairy stories!  
他创作了许多引人入胜的故事，描述了科学家和发明家未来可能实现的种种事物。在当时，人们觉得这些故事就像童话一样！

Many of Jules Verne's attempts to look into the future, however, were surprisingly accurate.  
然而，凡尔讷许多预言未来的尝试都令人惊讶地准确。

For example, one book was called From Earth to Moon. In this book, three men and a dog made a journey around the moon. They dis this in a hollow "ship" fired from a gun. After going round the moon, they returned to the earth and splashed down into the sea not far from where the first real moon travelers landed in July 1969, about a hundred years later!  
例如，他的一部小说名为《从地球到月球》。书中讲述了三个人和一条狗乘坐一个空心“炮弹”被发射升空，环绕月球后返回地球，溅落到大海中，而这距离人类首次登月（1969 年 7 月）竟然相差不到一百年，地点也十分接近！

In all his books Jules Verne used his scientific knowledge as well as his imagination in describing future inventions. Sometimes he was wrong, of course, but often the accuray of his descriptions is very surprising.  
凡尔讷在他的所有作品中，都巧妙地结合了科学知识和想象力，描绘了未来的发明创造。当然，他有时也会出错，但其描述的准确性往往令人惊叹。

## Passage

The cirumstances surrounding the birth of a female infant in Kosciusko, Mississippi, on Jan. 29, 1954, were not promising.
1954 年 1 月 29 日，密西西比州科修斯科县出生的一名女婴的状况并不乐观。

Present was the usual mix that had so often accumulated into a burden too heavy for a single-parent household like the one Oprah Winfrey grew up in.
目前的情况很常见，这些情况经常会累积成一个难以承受的负担，对于像奥普拉·温弗瑞长大的单亲家庭来说，这是一个沉重的负担。

The state in which she was born had laws in place waiting to characterize her as unwelcome, to bar her participation in otherwise acceptable social activities, to shackle her to the residue of slavery and other injustices of the past.
她出生的那个州有法律限制她的权利，让她无法参与正常的社会活动，将她禁锢在过去奴隶制和不公正的阴影之下。

The simple truth is that her grandmother, her great-grandmother and all the great-great-grandmothers before them never expericenced one day of life free from the harsh decrees of state-sponsored racial repression.
事实上，她的祖母、曾祖母以及所有再前一辈的女性都从未体验过一天没有种族歧视压迫的生活。

In hindsight, it appears that her birth was an uneventful one. But at age three she was reciting speeched from church pulpits. Upon discovering books, the child delved into the written word, turning out weekly book reports for her father. Even during turbulent times, not a moment was wasted. Seeds were being planted, watered, and nurtured.
从现在来看，她似乎出生得平凡无奇。但三岁时，她就能背诵教堂讲坛上的演讲词。当她发现书籍后，便沉迷于文字的世界，每周为父亲写读书报告。即使在动荡不安的时期，她也从未浪费一分一秒。种子被种下，浇灌，并茁壮成长。

On April 13, 1964, nearly an adolescent and watching television from the linoleum floor of her mother's walk-up flat in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, she witnessed an event that connected to something deep inside of her. She was watching the live broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony and saw a young African-American actor receiving the film industry's highest honor. Sharing in that moment and all it implied, she later told me, caused her to say softly to herself, "If he can do that, I wonder what I could do?"
1964 年 4 月 13 日，当时奥普拉还只是一个即将进入青春期的少女，正坐在位于威斯康辛州密尔沃基母亲公寓的油毡地板上看电视。她目睹了一件让她内心深处产生共鸣的事件。她正在观看奥斯卡颁奖典礼的直播，并看到一位年轻的非裔美国演员获得了电影界最高荣誉。她后来告诉我，正是那一刻让她意识到自己的可能性，她轻聲对自己说：“如果他能做到，那我能做什么呢？”

The ground had been set. The journey of Oprah Winfrey had gegun.
一切准备就绪，奥普拉·温弗里的旅程开始了。

The babe, the child, the adolescent, the young woman -- all their strengths were harnessed into a force of astonishing power that placed itself in the service of nature and the human family. That the world has changed in meaningful ways since 1954 is beyond question.
婴儿、孩童、少女、年轻女性——她们所有的力量都凝聚成一股令人惊异的力量，为自然界和人类家庭服务。毫无疑问，自 1954 年以来，世界已经发生了重大变化。

Oprah and her activities were driving forces in many of those changes. Her enormously influential talk show, her philanthropic work with children in Africa and elsewhere, her popular book club and magazine, her empowering spiritual message, her contribution (by action and example) to improving race relations -- all speak to the human family, touching hearts and leaving each one uplifted.
奥普拉和她的事业是许多变革的驱动力量。她影响力巨大的脱口秀、她在非洲和其他地方为儿童做的慈善工作、她受欢迎的读书俱乐部和杂志、她赋予人们力量的精神信息、她为改善种族关系所做的贡献（通过行动和榜样）——所有这些都触动了人类大家庭，抚慰人心，让人们充满力量。

Mississippi too seems to be mellowing out into a more congenial place than it was in 1954. That may also be partly due to the very special energy that is Oprah Winfrey -- a courageous, funny, compassionate, well-informed, dazzlingly curious person, as down-to-earth and loving as any human being I've ever known.
密西西比州似乎也变得比 1954 年更加宜居。这也许也部分归功于奥普拉·温弗里这位拥有非凡能量的人——她勇敢、风趣、富有同情心、知识渊博、好奇心爆棚，她就像我所认识的任何其他人一样朴实和充满爱。

**Part B**

Questions 4-6 are based on the following story.

A gentleman `put an advertisement in a newspaper` for a boy to `work in` his office. Out of `nearly fifty persons who came to apply`, the man selected one and `dismissed` the others.  
一位先生在报纸上登了一则广告，招聘一个男孩到他的办公室工作。在将`近五十个前来应聘的人`中，这位先生选中了一个并`打发`走了其他人。

"`I should like to know`," said a friend, "the reason you `preferred` that boy, who brought not a single `letter`, not a single `recommendation`."  
“`我想知道`，”一位朋友说，“你为什么会选择那个既没有带`介绍`信也没有`推荐`信的男孩？”

"You are wrong," said the gentleman. "He had `a great many`. He `wiped his feet` at the door and closed the door behind him, showing that `he was careful`. He `gave` his seat `immediately` to that old man, showing that `he was kind and thoughtful`. He took off his cap when he came in and answered my questions `promptly`, showing that `he was polite and gentlemanly`."  
“你错了，”那位先生说。“他有很多推荐信。他在门口擦了脚并关上了门，说明`他很细心`。他`立即`把座位让给了那位老人，说明`他很善良和体贴`。他进来时摘下了帽子，并`迅速`回答了我的问题，说明`他很有礼貌和绅士风度`。”

"All the `rest` `stepped over` the book which I had `purposely` put on the floor. He picked it up and placed it on the table, and he waited quietly for his turn `instead of pushing and crowding`. When I talked to him, I noticed his `tidy clothing`, his `neatly brushed hair` and his `clean finger nails`. Can't you see that these things are `excellent` recommendations? I consider them more `significant` than letters."  
“其他所有`人`都`跨过`了我`故意`放在地上的书，而他捡起来放在了桌上，并且他安静地等候轮到自己，`而不是推挤`。当我和他交谈时，我注意到他的`衣服整洁`，`头发梳理得很整齐`，`指甲`也很干净。你难道看不出这些都是`很好`的推荐信吗？我认为这些比信件更`重要`。”

Questions 7-10 are based on the following story.

The year was 1912. Mrs. Straus and her husband were `passengers` on the Titanic during its `fateful voyage`. Not many women went down with the ship, but Mrs. Straus was one of the few women who did not survive for one simple reason: She could not `bear to leave` her husband.  
那是 1912 年。斯特劳斯夫妇是泰坦尼克号上不幸的一次航行的乘客。虽然下沉时没有多少女性随船沉没，但斯特劳斯夫人是少数几个没有幸存的女性之一，原因很简单：她无法`忍受离开`她的丈夫。

This is how Mabel Bird, Mrs. Straus's `servant`, who `survived the disaster`, told the story after she was saved.  
这是斯特劳斯夫人的`仆人`梅贝尔·伯德在获救后讲述的故事。

When the Titanic began to `sink`, `frightened` women and children were the first `ones` loaded into `lifeboats`. Mr. and Mrs. Straus were calm and comforting other passengers, and helped many of them into the boats.  
当泰坦尼克号开始`下沉`时，`惊恐的`妇女和儿童是最先被安置在`救生艇`上的。斯特劳斯夫妇保持冷静，并安慰其他乘客，帮助许多人上了救生艇。

Then, Mr. Straus `begged` his wife to get into the lifeboat with her servant and others. Mrs. Straus started to get in. She had one foot on the `edge`, but then suddenly, `she changed her mind`, turned away and stepped back onto the sinking ship.  
然后，斯特劳斯先生`恳求`他的妻子和她的仆人及其他人一起上救生艇。斯特劳斯夫人开始上船。她的一只脚已经踩在了`边缘`上，但突然之间，她改变了主意，转身回到了正在下沉的船上。

'Please, dear, get into the boat!' her husband `urged`.  
“亲爱的，请上船！”她的丈夫`催促`道。

'No,' Mrs. Straus is said to have `replied with resistance`. 'I will not get into the boat. We have been together through `a great many years`. We are old now. I will not leave you. `Where you go, I will go`.'  
“不，”据说斯特劳斯夫人`坚决地回答`。“我不会上船的。我们一起度过了`很多年`。我们现在都老了。我不会离开你。你去哪里，我就去哪里。”

And that is where they were last seen, standing` arm in arm` on the `deck`, this `devoted wife` `clinging courageously` to her husband, this loving husband clinging `protectively` to his wife, as the ship `sank`."
最后一次看到他们时，他们正`臂挽着臂`站在`甲板`上，这位` 忠诚的妻子``勇敢地依偎着 `她的丈夫，这位深爱的丈夫`保护性地`抱着他的妻子，随着船一起沉没。

### Section II Use of English

In the spring of 2000, when we were working to secure $435 million in debt relief for the developing world that President Clinton had promised, a friendly senator took Bono and me to a private office near the U.S. Capitol.  
在 2000 年春天，当我们努力为发展中国家争取克林顿总统承诺的 4.35 亿美元债务减免时，一位友好的参议员带着 Bono 和我到美国国会大厦附近的一间私人办公室。

"I think we can `make` a deal at about $200 million," the `lawmaker` said. He had been told that by "certain people".  
“我认为我们可以**达成**大约 2 亿美元的协议，”这位**立法者**说。他是从“某些人”那里得知这个消息的。

We knew that the original `offer` was just $60 million to $70 million. "`Declare` victory and go home," our friend `advised`.  
我们知道最初的**报价**只是 6000 万到 7000 万美元。“**宣布**胜利然后回家吧，”我们的朋友**建议**道。

Bono said, "No, we need the full $435 million." There was an `awkward` moment.  
Bono 说：“不，我们需要全部的 4.35 亿美元。”场面有点**尴尬**。

"And another thing," Bono continued. "If 'certain people' `fight` it, tell them U2 will come to their `districts`, get 50,000 kids in a stadium and put their photo on 30-ft. screens with the words, 'This guy `killed` African women and children.'"  
“还有一件事，”Bono 继续说道。“如果‘某些人’**反对**，就告诉他们 U2 会去他们的**选区**，在体育场聚集 5 万名孩子，并在 30 英尺的屏幕上展示他们的照片，并写上‘这个家伙**杀死了**非洲的妇女和儿童’。”

That's `why` Bono is a hero. Not because he's a rock star, but because he's a rock star who is `willing` to spend time on things that are `boring` - like long sessions with senators and `meetings` at the World Bank.  
这就是 Bono 成为英雄的**原因**。不是因为他是摇滚明星，而是因为他是愿意花时间在**枯燥**事务上的摇滚明星——比如和参议员长时间的会谈和在世界银行的**会议**。

Why?

Here's the `answer`. When Bono and his wife Ali first went to `Africa`, they worked in a refugee camp for a mounth. On the day they were leaving, a man `approached` him carrying a baby. "This is my son," the man said. "Please take him with you when you leave. if you do, he will live. `Otherwise` he will die."  
这里是**答案**。当 Bono 和他的妻子 Ali 第一次去**非洲**时，他们在一个难民营工作了一个月。就在他们离开的那天，一名男子**走近**他，抱着一个婴儿。“这是我的儿子，”那名男子说。“请你在离开时带上他。如果你带走他，他将活下来。**否则**他会死。”

I have heard Bono `tell` that story several times. Each time, I think he is haunted by the horror `that` this unjust moment is repeated every day across Africa. He has `devoted` his life to making sure that such extreme poverty comes to an end.  
我听 Bono**讲述**这个故事很多次了。每次，我都觉得他被这种不公正的时刻所**困扰**，而这种时刻每天都在非洲重复。他**致力于**确保这种极端贫困能够结束。
