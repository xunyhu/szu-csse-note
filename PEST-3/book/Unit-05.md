## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Matt Taylor is talking with one of his viewers about his job as a television weather `forecaster`.  
马特·泰勒 (Matt Taylor) 正在与一位观众谈论他作为电视天气`预报员`的工作。

Interviewer: When did you become a weather forecaster?  
采访人：您什么时候成为一名天气预报员的？

Matt Taylor: I joined the BBC Weather Centre in June 1992 and did my first live broadcast about six months later.  
马特·泰勒：我于 1992 年 6 月加入 BBC 气象中心，大约六个月后进行了我的第一次现场直播。

Interviewer: Why did you want to be a weather forecaster?  
采访人：您为什么想成为一名天气预报员？

Matt Taylor: I am passionate about the weather, and the challenge of presenting weather information to the public, especially in times of severe weather, in a coherent and pleasant style, was the principal motivation.  
马特·泰勒：我对天气充满热情，而向公众呈现天气信息（尤其是在恶劣天气下）的挑战是以连贯而愉快的方式呈现的，这是我的主要动机。

Interviewer: Do you get nervous before a broadcast?  
采访人：播出前会紧张吗？

Matt Taylor: I do, but not as much as in the early days! If the forecast is complicated, then I do get nervous about whether I will present it well and effectively, as I want to do a good job. If I think there is a lot to say, I sometimes speak too fast, which makes me nervous, so I do exercises to calm myself down.  
Matt Taylor：我会，但不像以前那么频繁了！如果预测很复杂，我会担心自己能否很好地、有效地进行陈述，因为我想把事情做好。如果我觉得有很多话要说，我有时会说得太快，这让我很紧张，所以我会做一些练习来让自己平静下来。

Interviewer: Have you ever made any mistakes?  
采访人：您曾经犯过错误吗？

Matt Taylor: Yes, meteorology is a complex science. It's important to know what elements of the forecast are subject to error. Often I find making mistakes is a good way to learn, and you don't make the same mistake twice.  
马特·泰勒：是的，气象学是一门复杂的科学。了解预报的哪些要素容易出错非常重要。我发现犯错往往是学习的好方法，而且你不会犯同样的错误两次。

Interviewer: Is your job hard?  
面试官：你的工作辛苦吗？

Matt Taylor: I would say challenging rather than hard. I feel when you've got it, you've got it. There is a lot of information to absorb in a relatively short period of time — that is probably the hardest part.  
马特·泰勒：与其说是困难，不如说是挑战。我觉得，当你掌握了，你就掌握了。在相对较短的时间内，你需要吸收大量信息——这可能是最困难的部分。

Interviewer: Do you enjoy your job?  
面试官：你喜欢你的工作吗？

Matt Taylor: Yes. It's exciting and challenging. The British weather is always changing, and is never the same two days running. I consider myself lucky to have found a job which is enjoyable and utilizes my physics degree.  
马特·泰勒：是的。这很令人兴奋，也很有挑战性。英国的天气总是变化无常，而且两天都不一样。我很幸运能找到一份既有趣又能利用我的物理学位的工作。

Interviewer: What job would you do if you were not a TV weather forecaster?  
采访人：如果您不担任电视天气预报员，您会从事什么工作？

Matt Taylor: I don't know. But having been brought up in the countryside, would like a job which allowed me to be out in the fresh air as much as possible.  
马特·泰勒：我不知道。但我在农村长大，希望能找到一份能让我尽可能多呼吸新鲜空气的工作。

The following is a summary of the BBC live weather forecast by Jay Wynne for the U.K. on September 16th, 2004.  
以下是 Jay Wynne 于 2004 年 9 月 16 日对英国 BBC 现场天气预报的摘要。

Overnight into the 16th September 2004 we saw the winds strengthen over the northwest of the U.K. Those mighty winds pulled in a bank of cloud and some patchy rain through the small hours and into the first part of the morning.  
2004 年 9 月 16 日夜间，我们看到英国西北部的风力增强。强大的风在凌晨至清晨带来了一片云层和零星降雨。

It was a different story in the southeast of the U.K., clearer skies and much lighter winds allowed temperatures to drop well into single figures resulting in a touch of ground frost in some rural areas. Redhill Airport is a notorious cold spot and here we even saw a slight air frost as temperatures dipped down to 0°C for a short time early in the morning.  
英国东南部的情况则有所不同，天空更加晴朗，风力也小了很多，气温下降到个位数，导致一些农村地区出现了轻微的地面霜冻。雷德希尔机场是出了名的寒冷地区，我们甚至在这里看到了轻微的空气霜冻，因为清晨气温短暂降至 0°C。

For the bulk of the day, England and Wales were dry and bright with the early sunshine giving way to a bit more cloud through the afternoon as the winds picked up a little. Most places had a fine day with some sunshine with Norfolk seeing the lion's share with 11 full hours worth. The highest temperature was to be found in Kent where 20°C was recorded.  
英格兰和威尔士大部分时间天气干燥明亮，早间的阳光在下午逐渐转为多云，风力稍有增强。大部分地方天气晴朗，阳光明媚，诺福克郡阳光最多，长达 11 小时。肯特郡气温最高，记录为 20°C。

Things were very different for Northern Ireland and Scotland. After the light and patchy rain through the early hours of the morning, there was something of a drier interlude before an active weather system moved in from the west. This brought some heavy rain and strong winds with it. Some of the more exposed locations saw sustained winds of 40mph with gusts of 58mph. Temperatures struggled in the wet and windy conditions, and Shetland saw the lowest daytime temperature of 13°C.  
北爱尔兰和苏格兰的情况则截然不同。在清晨几小时的小雨之后，天气稍显干燥，随后一个活跃的天气系统从西部袭来。这带来了一些大雨和强风。一些暴露较多的地区持续风速达到 40 英里/小时，阵风达到 58 英里/小时。在潮湿多风的天气中，气温难以忍受，设得兰群岛的白天最低气温为 13°C。

The wettest place turned out to be Dumfries where 16mm of rain was collected and while it was wet for much of the day the majority of that fell during the late afternoon.  
最潮湿的地方是邓弗里斯，那里降雨量为 16 毫米，虽然一天中的大部分时间都是潮湿的，但大多数降雨都发生在下午晚些时候。

Through the evening the rain cleared away from Northern Ireland and most of Scotland and the winds began to ease. At the same time the wind and rain settled in over Northern England, Wales and the southwest of England.  
到了晚上，北爱尔兰和苏格兰大部分地区的雨势逐渐减弱，风势也开始减弱。与此同时，英格兰北部、威尔士和英格兰西南部地区开始出现风雨。

Helen Taylor is a radio weather forecaster and the following is her summary of the weather conditions for the U.K. on Monday, the 13th of September 2004.  
海伦·泰勒是一名电台天气预报员，以下是她对 2004 年 9 月 13 日星期一英国天气状况的总结。

There was a real sense of autumn about the weather on Monday the 13th of September. During the early hours a band of showery rain swept across the U.K. and the clearing skies meant a cold start to the day for Northern Ireland which saw temperatures fall back to 6 Celsius.  
9 月 13 日星期一的天气确实有种秋天的感觉。凌晨时分，英国迎来了阵雨，天空转晴，北爱尔兰迎来了寒冷的一天，气温降至 6 摄氏度。

During the morning the rain quickly cleared away from southeast England. However it did leave behind a legacy of blustery showers. During the day these showers became heavy and thundery at times, particularly across the southern half of England and Wales.  
早晨，英格兰东南部的雨水很快消散。然而，它留下了一阵狂风暴雨。白天，这些阵雨有时变得猛烈，并伴有雷雨，尤其是在英格兰南部和威尔士。

Oxford was the wettest place at least until 18: 00 GMT. Here, 50mm of rain was recorded.  
至少在格林威治标准时间 18:00 之前，牛津是降雨量最多的地方。这里记录到的降雨量为 50 毫米。

During the afternoon and evening the showers gradually grouped together to produce longer spells of rain particularly across Northern Ireland and Scotland.  
下午和晚上，阵雨逐渐聚集，带来较长时间的降雨，尤其是在北爱尔兰和苏格兰。

The weather faired much better at the other end of the U.K. Plymouth basked in 9 hours of sunshine which lifted the temperature to a respectable 19 Celsius.  
英国另一端的天气好得多，普利茅斯沐浴了 9 个小时的阳光，温度上升到了可观的 19 摄氏度。

Showers did eventually gather across the southwest too but the heaviest of these arrived after dusk. In fact there were quite a crop of showers by the evening and also some very strong winds. Later on the winds began gusting to gale force in some exposed spots leading to some rather unpleasant conditions for many western and southern parts of England and Wales.  
西南地区最终也开始下雨，但最猛烈的雨是在黄昏后到来的。事实上，傍晚时分，阵雨不断，风也非常强。后来，在一些暴露的地方，风开始阵阵猛烈，导致英格兰和威尔士西部和南部许多地区出现相当令人不快的情况。

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

The following is a news report about climate and economy.  
以下是有关气候和经济的新闻报道。

Weather and climate affect the wealth of a country. Where the climate is too inhospitable to grow much food, or for farmers to raise livestock, a country may have to import much of its foodstuffs. If they have no other sources of natural wealth, such as mining or petroleum, they may be restricted in their growth.  
天气和气候影响一个国家的财富。如果气候太不适宜种植大量粮食，或农民无法饲养牲畜，一个国家可能不得不进口大量粮食。如果他们没有其他自然资源，如采矿或石油，他们的增长可能会受到限制。

Countries where there is regular drought may be subject to famine and disease if the economy is not managed properly and valuable resources are exported rather than re-invested. Many developing countries rely on growing “cash crops" which they can export and this may limit the amount of self sufficiency they can maintain in a time of crisis. Countries with good climates for agriculture can both feed their people and export the surplus, growing rich enough to diversify into other types of work.  
如果经济管理不善，宝贵的资源被出口而不是再投资，经常发生干旱的国家可能会遭受饥荒和疾病。许多发展中国家依赖种植可以出口的“经济作物”，这可能会限制它们在危机时期能够维持的自给自足程度。气候适宜农业的国家既可以养活本国人民，又可以出口剩余产品，从而变得足够富裕，可以从事其他类型的工作。

Every year, we hear about natural disasters and “acts of God” which wipe out crops, sometimes entire harvests, and cause millions of pounds of damage. Many weather events have the power to do this. Storms, hail, extreme cold, extreme heat, and flooding can all kill crops and animals - as well as people. Indirectly, weather events can also cause disease, a rise in pest populations, bushfires, and some say even civil disturbances and riots.  
每年，我们都会听到自然灾害和“天灾”的消息，它们摧毁了农作物，有时甚至摧毁了整个收成，造成了数百万英镑的损失。许多天气事件都有这样的威力。风暴、冰雹、极寒、极热和洪水都可能杀死农作物和动物——以及人类。间接地，天气事件还可能导致疾病、害虫种群增加、森林火灾，有人甚至说还会导致内乱和骚乱。

The stock market has trading on future harvests and periods of natural disaster may cause the market to fluctuate wildly. Insurance companies may suffer losses of billions of pounds, also destabilizing certain industries astheir losses and premiums mount up. Delays and penalties to international trade, construction work and manufacturing can also be affected greatly by weather events.  
股票市场的交易取决于未来的收成，自然灾害时期可能会导致市场剧烈波动。保险公司可能遭受数十亿英镑的损失，随着损失和保费的增加，某些行业的稳定也会受到影响。国际贸易、建筑工程和制造业的延误和罚款也会受到天气事件的极大影响。

The Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming  
温室效应和全球变暖

The heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere is popularly known as the “greenhouse effect”. Despite public controversy surrounding global warming, the natural greenhouse effect has been long established as fact in the scientific community. Indeed, were it not for the heat-trapping action of clouds, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases, the earth's natural climate would be about 33℃ cooler than it is. Life would have evolved quite differently in such a climate.  
大气的吸热能力通常被称为“温室效应”。尽管公众对全球变暖存在争议，但自然温室效应早已被科学界确认为事实。事实上，如果没有云、水蒸气、二氧化碳和其他气体的吸热作用，地球的自然气候将比现在低 33℃ 左右。在这样的气候下，生命的进化将截然不同。

Most scientists believe that the rapid expansion of agricultural and industrial activities over the last several hundred years have generated significant increases in carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. However, experts disagree about whether such changes have caused the increase of approximately 0.5°C in the earth's surface temperature that has been documented over the past century. Many scientists cite the fact that 1997 was the warmest year on record, following a decade in which 9 of the 11 hottest years this century were reported, as strong, but circumstantial, evidence that human activities have altered the earth's climate. Other experts, however, believe this temperature trend is a natural variation.  
大多数科学家认为，过去几百年来，农业和工业活动的迅速扩张导致大气中二氧化碳和甲烷的含量大幅增加。然而，专家们对于这些变化是否导致过去一个世纪地球表面温度上升约 0.5°C 存在分歧。许多科学家引用了这样一个事实：1997 年是有记录以来最热的一年，而本世纪 11 个最热年份中有 9 个出现在这十年中，这是人类活动改变了地球气候的有力但间接的证据。然而，其他专家认为，这种温度趋势是一种自然变化。

Also disputed is whether projected world population growth to more than 10 bilion people by the year 2100 will result in a doubling or tripling of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. If such a buildup occurs, as many scientists predict, global surface temperatures could increase by anywhere from about one Celsius degree to about 4 Celsius degrees during the next century. The higher half of this range involves temperature changes outside of those experienced by human civilizations since the end of the last ice age some 10,000 years ago. During the last ice age, average global temperatures were only about 5 Celsius degrees cooler than the present period.  
另一个有争议的问题是，到 2100 年，预计世界人口将增长至 100 多亿，这是否会导致大气中二氧化碳浓度增加一倍或三倍。如果像许多科学家预测的那样，出现这样的累积，全球地表温度在下个世纪可能会上升约 1 摄氏度到 4 摄氏度。这一范围的上半部分涉及的温度变化超出了自大约 10,000 年前上一个冰河时代结束以来人类文明所经历的温度变化。在上一个冰河时代，全球平均气温仅比现在低约 5 摄氏度。

A temperature increase of several degrees Celsius could result in a sea level rise ranging from about 10 cm to about 1 m. A sea level rise of about 0.5 m would be noticeable primarily in the most vulnerable, low-lying islands and coastal areas. Larger sea level rises would result in extensive flooding of lowland beaches, wetlands, and coastal settlements. Moreover, a higher sea level base would increase the risk of catastrophic storm surges in coastal areas, since flooding would likely extend inland well beyond historic levels.  
温度升高几摄氏度可能导致海平面上升约 10 厘米到 1 米。海平面上升约 0.5 米将主要出现在最脆弱的低洼岛屿和沿海地区。海平面上升幅度更大将导致低地海滩、湿地和沿海定居点被大面积淹没。此外，更高的海平面基准将增加沿海地区发生灾难性风暴潮的风险，因为洪水可能会蔓延到内陆，远远超过历史水平。

Warmer temperatures could also intensify droughts in some regions, destabilize ecosystems, and cause the decline or extinction of some species. Since carbon dioxide enhances photosynthesis, some scientists have calculated that higher concentrations in the atmosphere would increase the productivity of crops and forests. But others have pointed out that carbon dioxide increases and a warming climate could encourage the spread of destructive pests, including weeds and disease-carrying insects.  
气温升高还可能加剧某些地区的干旱，破坏生态系统，导致某些物种的减少或灭绝。由于二氧化碳能增强光合作用，一些科学家计算出，大气中二氧化碳浓度的升高将提高农作物和森林的产量。但另一些人指出，二氧化碳的增加和气候变暖可能会助长破坏性害虫的蔓延，包括杂草和携带疾病的昆虫。
