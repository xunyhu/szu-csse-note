## Dialogue/Monologue 1

David is the `Operations manager` of the Waldorf Meridien Hotel in London. Now he is answering questions about `reservations`.  
David 是伦敦华尔道夫艾美酒店的`运营经理`。现在他负责回答有关`预订`的问题。

John: Could you please tell me how I can `make reservations` in your hotel?  
约翰：您能告诉我怎样预订你们的酒店吗？

David: You can book rooms in `a number of` ways, `including`, the most recently, the Internet, which is becoming more and more important for hotel `bookings`.  
David：您可以通过`多种`方式预订房间，包括最近流行的互联网，互联网对酒店预订越来越重要。  
I wouldn't say `overall` it is going to increase our bookings, but we `have to` be aware of it because it's a different `method of the way` guests can book.  
我不会说它`总体`上会增加我们的预订量，但我们`必须`意识到这一点，因为这是客人预订的一种不同`方式`。

John: Could you give me some tips on booking?  
约翰：您能给我一些预订方面的建议吗？

David: When making a booking, I suppose the most important thing to remember, if you are a `leisure traveler`, is to book as early as possible because that's when most of the discount or `promotional` offers will be available.  
David：预订时，我认为最重要的是要记住，如果你是`休闲旅客`，请尽早预订，因为那时大多数折扣或`促销`优惠都有效。  
When you make the reservation always, ask if you are making it by phone or the Internet, always ask for or write down the `confirmation` number.  
预订时，请务必询问是通过电话还是互联网预订，务必索要或记下`确认`号码。  
And they will then `be able to` easily find your booking, even if they have `spelt` your name wrong or something has `gone` wrong.  
这样，他们就可以轻松找到您的预订，即使他们`拼`错了您的名字或出了问题。  
If you have any `preferences` for rooms, such as you'd like a room which is `quiet`, or at the front of the hotel, or it's not near a `lift` or it is near a lift, then again I would advise you to write down the confirmation number. `would suggest`, or `recommend`, that you make these at the time of booking.  
如果您对房间有任何`偏好`，例如您想要一间`安静`的房间，或者位于酒店前面的房间，或者靠近`电梯`或不在电梯附近，那么我再次建议您记下确认号码。我`建议`或`推荐`您在预订时就做出这些选择。  
Once you check in on the day, those preferences will be available. To `guarantee` your room, hotels in London, or in England specially, will ask for a `credit card` or a confirmation which will `guarantee` that your room is `held`, basically all night or for late arrival.  
当您当天办理入住手续时，这些偏好将可用。为了`保证`您的房间，伦敦或英格兰的酒店会要求您提供`信用卡`或确认信息，以`保证`您的房间被`保留`，基本上是整晚或晚到。  
Most U.K. hotels will, if it is not `guaranteed` by a credit card, or some form of payment, will release the room between 2 and 4 p.m. now.  
如果没有信用卡`担保`或某种形式的付款，大多数英国酒店将在现在下午 2 点到 4 点之间释放房间。

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Clifford is `a new arrival` in London. He wants to know more about the `cinemas` in London. Now he is asking Kenneth about going to cinemas in London.  
Clifford 刚到伦敦。他想了解更多有关伦敦`电影院`的信息。现在他正在向 Kenneth 询问去伦敦电影院的事情。

Clifford: Hello, Kenneth. There seems to be `a variety of` films `going on` every day in London. How `shall` I choose the cinema to enjoy the films?  
Clifford：你好，Kenneth。伦敦似乎每天都有`各种各样`的电影`上映`。我该如何选择电影院来欣赏电影呢？

Kenneth: It `could` be `fairly difficult` to go to the cinema in London, because here are too many films and cinemas to choose from! Most of the central cinemas are around Leicester Square, showing big `blockbuster` movies.  
Kenneth：在伦敦去电影院可能`相当困难`，因为这里有太多的电影和电影院可供选择！大多数中心电影院都在莱斯特广场附近，放映`大片`。  
You can `wander` around and see which film `is to your appetite`. There's a lot of information telling you what's on if you look on the Internet or in Time Out magazine. `But be warned`-seeing a film can be an `expensive night` out in the center of town!  
你可以四处`逛逛`，看看哪部电影`合你的胃口`。如果你在网上或《Time Out》杂志上查找，有很多信息告诉你正在放映什么。`但要注意`——在市中心看电影可能是一个`昂贵的夜晚`！

Clifford: That's not good news for me. As you know, I am a poor student. So what can I do if I want to see `cheap` films?  
克利福德：这对我来说可不是个好消息。你知道，我是个穷学生。那么如果我想看`便宜`的电影，我该怎么办呢？

Kenneth: The `cheapest` cinema in Leicester Square is The Prince Charles. This cinema often shows films a few weeks later than some of the others, so if you don't mind being `a bit behind` the times and want to save `a couple of quid` this could be the `precise` place for you.  
肯尼斯：莱斯特广场`最便宜的`电影院是查尔斯王子电影院。这家电影院放映电影的时间通常比其他电影院晚几个星期，所以如果你不介意有点`落后`，而且想省`几英镑`，那么这里可能是你的`最佳`选择。  
If you become a member (five pounds per year) you can see films as little as 1.50 pounds, very `good value for money`!  
如果你成为会员（每年 5 英镑），你只需 1.50 英镑就可以看电影，非常`物有所值`！

Clifford: Very good advice. Is there any other kind of cinemas in London?  
克利福德：非常好的建议。伦敦还有其他类型的电影院吗？

Kenneth: There are other smaller `art-house cinemas` in town; one of these is 'Metro Cinema' on Rupert Street in Soho.  
Kenneth：伦敦还有其他一些较小的`艺术影院`，其中之一是位于苏豪区鲁珀特街的“Metro Cinema”。  
It shows `a wide variety` of movies but `tends` not to show more `mainstream` films. These films are made by `independent filmmakers` and are not aimed at `mass` audiences.  
它放映的电影`种类繁多`，但`往往`不放映`主流`电影。这些电影由`独立电影人`制作，不面向`大众`观众。  
Every year it also has the Latin American `Film Festival`. Another art-house cinema is the 'Curzon Soho'; Time Out readers recently `voted` this as London's number one cinema. It also shows `a broad range` of art-house films.  
它每年还会举办拉丁美洲`电影节`。另一家艺术影院是“Curzon Soho”；《Time Out》的读者最近将其`评为`伦敦第一影院。它还放映`各种`艺术电影。

Clifford: `Fantastic`! London is truly a `metropolitan` city. I `have to` think a lot before I make a `decision` and go to the cinema.  
克利福德：`太棒了`！伦敦真是个`大都市`。我`得`仔细考虑一下才能`决定`去不去电影院。

Kenneth: It truly is. Going to the cinema in London requires a lot of thinking, maybe you want to see a `famous star`, or `perhaps` a film by your favorite `director`, or just sit, eat `popcorn` and enjoy the latest Hollywood action movie. If you take time to look, there's something for everyone.  
Kenneth：确实如此。去伦敦的电影院需要深思熟虑，也许你想看一个`著名明星`，`或者`你最喜欢的`导演`的电影，或者只是坐下来，吃着`爆米花`，欣赏最新的好莱坞动作片。如果你花时间去寻找，每个人都能找到适合自己的电影。

默特尔：嗯，你们` 餐厅``主打 `汉堡和鸡肉，对吧？但我不喜欢`炸鸡`。我要培根芝士汉堡和一罐橙汁汽水。而且，你们推出特别优惠，每份三明治都免费赠送一份炸薯条，对吗？

默特尔：不用了，谢谢，这些就够了。这是我的免费`一小份薯条`的优惠券。来，把我的订单从这里拿走。作为`老年`人，我享有`特殊待遇`吗？（他递给店员一张十美元的钞票。）

Clerk:All our stores offer a ten-percent discount on all `purchases` over five dollars for people over sixty-five, but I must say that you don't look old enough to be called "senior."  
店员：我们所有商店都为 65 岁以上的人士提供`消费`超过 5 美元的 10% 折扣，但我必须说，您看上去还不够老，还不能被称为“老年人”。

Myrtle: You're too kind. Thank you, young lady.  
默特尔：您太客气了。谢谢您，小姑娘。

Clerk: Will this be to go or will you be eating here?  
店员：这是外带还是在这儿吃？

店员：在您等待订单时，这里有两张我们的大奖游戏卡。  
You have to `scratch` the `surface` of the cards and match the number which appears with one of the prize-winning numbers up there on our `bulletin board`. You could win up to ten thousand dollars.  
您必须`刮开`卡`面`，将出现的数字与我们`公告板`上的中奖号码之一匹配。您最多可赢得一万美元。

Myrtle: Oh, I never win anything.

Clerk:(She `prepares` his order.) Who knows? You might get lucky this time. I'd like to draw your attention to our breakfast menu upthere over the `food counter`.  
店员：（她`准备`他的订单。）谁知道呢？这次你可能会走运。我想请你注意`食品柜台`上的早餐菜单。

We should be rested when we arrive or we won't have a good visit.

路易斯：我同意。你为什么不看看旅游指南，看看它是否推荐这条`公路`上的`汽车旅馆`？  
The last sign we passed said that therewere a few small towns up ahead. There will probably be some motels..Well, look at that!

店员：只有一个，几分钟前才有空位。一对夫妇在去盐湖城的路上订了，但他们打电话说他们不能来了。  
This is a busy time of the year. You're lucky you found this one. Please `fill out this registration card` and be sure to list your `car's license number`. Will you be paying by `credit card`?  
这是一年中比较忙的时候。你很幸运找到了这个。请`填写这张登记卡`，并确保列出你的`车牌号码`。你会用`信用卡`支付吗？
