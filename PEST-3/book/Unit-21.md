## Dialogue/Monologue 1

David is the `Operations manager` of the Waldorf Meridien Hotel in London. Now he is answering questions about `reservations`.  
David 是伦敦华尔道夫艾美酒店的`运营经理`。现在他负责回答有关`预订`的问题。

John: Could you please tell me how I can make reservations in your hotel?  
约翰：您能告诉我怎样预订你们的酒店吗？

David: You can book rooms in a number of ways, including, the most recently, the Internet, which is becoming more and more important for hotel bookings. I wouldn't say overall it is going to increase our bookings, but we have to be aware of it because it's a different method of the way guests can book.  
David：您可以通过多种方式预订房间，包括最近流行的互联网，互联网对酒店预订越来越重要。我不会说它总体上会增加我们的预订量，但我们必须意识到这一点，因为这是客人预订的一种不同方式。

John: Could you give me some tips on booking?  
约翰：您能给我一些预订方面的建议吗？

David: When making a booking, I suppose the most important thing to remember, if you are a leisure traveler, is to book as early as possible because that's when most of the discount or promotional offers will be available. When you make the reservation always, ask if you are making it by phone or the Internet, always ask for or write down the confirmation number. And they will then be able to easily find your booking, even if they have spelt your name wrong or something has gone wrong. If you have any preferences for rooms, such as you'd like a room which is quiet, or at the front of the hotel, or it's not near a lift or it is near a lift, then again I would advise you to write down the confirmation number. would suggest, or recommend, that you make these at the time of booking. Once you check in on the day, those preferences will be available. To guarantee your room, hotels in London, or in England specially, will ask for a credit card or a confirmation which will guarantee that your room is held, basically all night or for late arrival. Most U.K. hotels will, if it is not guaranteed by a credit card, or some form of payment, will release the room between 2 and 4 p.m. now.  
David：预订时，我认为最重要的是要记住，如果你是休闲旅客，请尽早预订，因为那时大多数折扣或促销优惠都有效。预订时，请务必询问是通过电话还是互联网预订，务必索要或记下确认号码。这样，他们就可以轻松找到您的预订，即使他们拼错了您的名字或出了问题。如果您对房间有任何偏好，例如您想要一间安静的房间，或者位于酒店前面的房间，或者靠近电梯或不在电梯附近，那么我再次建议您记下确认号码。我建议或推荐您在预订时就做出这些选择。当您当天办理入住手续时，这些偏好将可用。为了保证您的房间，伦敦或英格兰的酒店会要求您提供信用卡或确认信息，以保证您的房间被保留，基本上是整晚或晚到。如果没有信用卡担保或某种形式的付款，大多数英国酒店将在现在下午 2 点到 4 点之间释放房间。

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Clifford is a new arrival in London. He wants to know more about the cinemas in London. Now he is asking Kenneth about going to cinemas in London.  
Clifford 刚到伦敦。他想了解更多有关伦敦电影院的信息。现在他正在向 Kenneth 询问去伦敦电影院的事情。

Clifford: Hello, Kenneth. There seems to be a variety of films going on every day in London. How shall I choose the cinema to enjoy the films?  
Clifford：你好，Kenneth。伦敦似乎每天都有各种各样的电影上映。我该如何选择电影院来欣赏电影呢？

Kenneth: It could be fairly difficult to go to the cinema in London, because here are too many films and cinemas to choose from! Most of the central cinemas are around Leicester Square, showing big blockbuster movies. You can wander around and see which film is to your appetite. There's a lot of information telling you what's on if you look on the Internet or in Time Out magazine. But be warned-seeing a film can be an expensive night out in the center of town!  
Kenneth：在伦敦去电影院可能相当困难，因为这里有太多的电影和电影院可供选择！大多数中心电影院都在莱斯特广场附近，放映大片。你可以四处逛逛，看看哪部电影合你的胃口。如果你在网上或《Time Out》杂志上查找，有很多信息告诉你正在放映什么。但要注意——在市中心看电影可能是一个昂贵的夜晚！

Clifford: That's not good news for me. As you know, I am a poor student. So what can I do if I want to see cheap films?  
克利福德：这对我来说可不是个好消息。你知道，我是个穷学生。那么如果我想看便宜的电影，我该怎么办呢？

Kenneth: The cheapest cinema in Leicester Square is The Prince Charles. This cinema often shows films a few weeks later than some of the others, so if you don't mind being a bit behind the times and want to save a couple of quid this could be the precise place for you. If you become a member (five pounds per year) you can see films as little as 1.50 pounds, very good value for money!  
肯尼斯：莱斯特广场最便宜的电影院是查尔斯王子电影院。这家电影院放映电影的时间通常比其他电影院晚几个星期，所以如果你不介意有点落后，而且想省几英镑，那么这里可能是你的最佳选择。如果你成为会员（每年 5 英镑），你只需 1.50 英镑就可以看电影，非常物有所值！

Clifford: Very good advice. Is there any other kind of cinemas in London?  
克利福德：非常好的建议。伦敦还有其他类型的电影院吗？

Kenneth: There are other smaller art-house cinemas in town; one of these is 'Metro Cinema' on Rupert Street in Soho. It shows a wide variety of movies but tends not to show more mainstream films. These films are made by independent filmmakers and are not aimed at mass audiences. Every year it also has the Latin American Film Festival. Another art-house cinema is the 'Curzon Soho'; Time Out readers recently voted this as London's number one cinema. It also shows a broad range of art-house films.  
Kenneth：伦敦还有其他一些较小的艺术影院，其中之一是位于苏豪区鲁珀特街的“Metro Cinema”。它放映的电影种类繁多，但往往不放映主流电影。这些电影由独立电影人制作，不面向大众观众。它每年还会举办拉丁美洲电影节。另一家艺术影院是“Curzon Soho”；《Time Out》的读者最近将其评为伦敦第一影院。它还放映各种艺术电影。

Clifford: Fantastic! London is truly a metropolitan city. I have to think a lot before I make a decision and go to the cinema.  
克利福德：太棒了！伦敦真是个大都市。我得仔细考虑一下才能决定去不去电影院。

Kenneth: It truly is. Going to the cinema in London requires a lot of thinking, maybe you want to see a famous star, or perhaps a film by your favorite director, or just sit, eat popcorn and enjoy the latest Hollywood action movie. If you take time to look, there's something for everyone.  
Kenneth：确实如此。去伦敦的电影院需要深思熟虑，也许你想看一个著名明星，或者你最喜欢的导演的电影，或者只是坐下来，吃着爆米花，欣赏最新的好莱坞动作片。如果你花时间去寻找，每个人都能找到适合自己的电影。

默特尔：不用了，谢谢，这些就够了。这是我的免费一小份薯条的优惠券。来，把我的订单从这里拿走。作为老年人，我享有特殊待遇吗？（他递给店员一张十美元的钞票。）

Clerk:All our stores offer a ten-percent discount on all purchases overfive dollars for people over sixty-five, but I must say that you don'tlook old enough to be called "senior."  
店员：我们所有商店都为 65 岁以上的人士提供消费超过 5 美元的 10% 折扣，但我必须说，您看上去还不够老，还不能被称为“老年人”。

Myrtle: You're too kind. Thank you, young lady.  
默特尔：您太客气了。谢谢您，小姑娘。

If you're ever in the mood for a fastand easy breakfast, we have a wide selection which we serve from6:30 to 10:30 a.m. Here you are. Your order is ready. Enjoy yourmeal and have a nice day.

Peter and Louis are feeling tired since they have been driving for a whole day. They decide to stop for the night at a motel.  
彼得和路易斯已经开了一整天的车，感觉很累。他们决定在一家汽车旅馆过夜。

Louis: I think we'd better stop for the night soon, dear. I'm getting tired of driving. You look as though you're done in too.  
路易斯：亲爱的，我想我们最好尽快停下来过夜。我开车累了。你看起来也累坏了。

Peter: I am. Ten hours on the road is long enough for anyone. Especially in thisheat. I'm anxious to get to Mom's but I don't think we should overdo it. We should be rested when we arrive or we won't have a good visit.  
彼得：是的。对任何人来说，在路上待十个小时都够久了。尤其是在这种高温下。我急着要去妈妈家，但我认为我们不应该太急。到达后我们应该休息一下，否则我们就不会好好探望妈妈了。

Louis: I agree. Why don't you look in the travel guide to see if it recommends any motels along this highway? The last sign we passed said that therewere a few small towns up ahead.There will probably be some motels..Well, look at that! No sooner do we start to look for a motel, when one appears. Let's pull over and have a look.  
路易斯：我同意。你为什么不看看旅游指南，看看它是否推荐这条公路上的汽车旅馆？我们经过的最后一个路标说前面有几个小镇。可能会有一些汽车旅馆……好吧，看看那个！我们刚开始寻找汽车旅馆，就出现了一家。我们把车停在路边看看吧。

Peter:PUh-oh,a "No Vacancy"sign.I hope we don't run into that problem.I'dhate to sleep in the car all night.  
彼得：哎呀，一个“客满”的标志。我希望我们不会遇到这个问题。我不想整晚睡在车里。

Louis:I'm sure we won't have to. What does the book say?  
路易斯：我相信我们不必这么做。书上是怎么说的？

Peter:Let me look at it. There's another nearby. Turn right at that road upthere. It's about half a mile down that road. It's not far.
