## Dialogue/Monologue 1

John Travolta, a `notable` actor, is talking with Susan Grant, `a reporter`, about one aspect of his personality that appeals to his fans.  
约翰·特拉沃尔塔（John Travolta），一位`著名`演员，正在与`记者`苏珊·格兰特（Susan Grant）谈论他人格魅力中吸引粉丝的一面。

Grant: Your fans `think of` you `as one of Hollywood's nice guys`. Why is that?  
格兰特：你的粉丝认为你是好莱坞的好人之一。为什么会这样呢？

Travolta: When I was eighteen. I had met a `brilliant Broadway star` who now is quite `nameless`. As he talked to me, the star was so shocked that I `interrupted` him.  
特拉沃尔塔：当我十八岁的时候，我遇到了一位现在已经无名的`杰出百老汇明星`。当他和我说话时，我插嘴打断了他，这让他非常震惊。  
I thought, that's right; I was `bold and illmannered`. `Nevertheless`, I `was impacted so deeply` that I made a decision:  
我当时想，是的，我太`大胆和无礼`了。然而，这件事`对我影响非常深刻`，我决定：  
I thought, I don't ever want to have the effect on a person that this person had on me, where `I was just blown away by disappintment`. It took a few years to `get over it`.  
我想，我永远不想再对别人产生像这个人对我那样的影响，当时`我感到非常失望`。我花了几年时间才从这件事中走出来。

Grant: Do you feel like you've made a difference `in your career` -- like `the inverse of the way` that star `treated` you all those years ago?  
格兰特：你觉得`在你的职业生涯中`，你对待别人的方式有改变吗？就像那位明星多年前`对待`你的方式`相反`吗？

Travolta: I hope so. One thing I do is work with Make-A-Wish. If an ill child's one wish is to see a `celebrity` and he picks me, then I make time to see him.  
特拉沃尔塔：我希望如此。我做的一件事就是和“实现愿望基金会”（Make-A-Wish）合作。如果有病重的孩子唯一的愿望是见到一位`名人`，而他选择了我，那么我会抽出时间去见他。  
But I have to be very careful with these kids, because if you `get too attached`, you're just setting yourself up for loss.  
但我必须非常小心，因为如果你和这些孩子`走得太近`，会让自己陷入失落。  
There was one girl who had cancer. She was only seven when I met her, and she didn't look like she was going to make it.  
有一个女孩得了癌症。我第一次见到她时她只有七岁，看起来不太可能会好转。  
But I'm at the airport the other night in L.A., and this beautiful 19-year-old girl comes up and says, "Do you remember me? I was the Make-A-Wish girl."  
但前几晚我在洛杉矶的机场，这个美丽的 19 岁女孩走过来问我：“你还记得我吗？我是那个‘实现愿望’的女孩。”  
And she took a picture out of her with a `bald head and wearing a scarf`. "After that visit with you," she said, "I just decided, I ain't going anywhere. Thank you for giving me `the inspiration to stick around`." At age 50, you have to feel you're `contributing to something`.  
她拿出一张自己戴着`头巾、光头`的照片。她说：“在那次和你见面后，我决定，我不会离开这个世界。谢谢你给了我`坚持下去的动力`。”到了五十岁，你会觉得自己`对社会有所贡献`。

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

David Andrews, a successful businessman and an `amateur pilot`, is talking with Barbara Johnson, from a news `magazine`, about his family.  
大卫·安德鲁斯（David Andrews），一位成功的商人和`业余飞行员`，正在与新闻杂志的芭芭拉·约翰逊（Barbara Johnson）谈论他的家庭。

Johnson: Are your kids having a much different experience than you did growing up?  
约翰逊：你的孩子们的成长经历和你小时候有什么不同吗？

Andrews: We were more important than my parents were, in their eyes. I feel that that's how my wife and I are with out kids. They're the starts of our family. `They're everything to us, and we are secondary to them`. People may disagree with that viewpoint, but I don't know how to be any other way.  
安德鲁斯：在我父母眼中，我们比他们自己更重要。我觉得这也是我和妻子对待孩子的方式。他们是我们家庭的明星，他们对我们来说就是一切，而我们是次要的。人们可能不同意这种观点，但我不知道该怎么做其他方式。

Johnson: What has brought you the greatest personal happiness in you life?  
约翰逊：在你的生活中，什么带给你最大的个人幸福？

Andrews: My children. I know that sounds chiche, but there's a reason things are chiche. Because they're true.  
安德鲁斯：我的孩子们。我知道这听起来像陈词滥调，但陈词滥调之所以存在是有原因的。因为它们是真的。

Johnson: What kinds of things do you do just for fun?  
约翰逊：你为了娱乐会做些什么事情？

Andrews: Last weekend, I took the kids to Orlando. We stayed at the RitzCarlton and just had a blast. Or I'll give everybody a ride in the Ultra-light -- it's a flying kite. But we alse do the regular stuff -- go to a movie, have a Sunday barbecue, swim. At the end of the day, we go to Dairy Queen. It's funny because that's exactly what I used to do on Sundays during the summer with my mother and father.  
安德鲁斯：上个周末，我带孩子们去了奥兰多。我们住在丽思卡尔顿酒店，玩得非常开心。或者我会带大家乘坐超轻型飞机——它是一种飞行风筝。不过我们也做些普通的事情——去看电影，举办周日烧烤，游泳。一天结束时，我们会去冰淇淋店。有趣的是，这正是我小时候夏天的周日与父母一起做的事情。

Johnson: Are you just as happy as you were a child?  
约翰逊：你现在和小时候一样幸福吗？

Andrews: Oh, were, more. Because I have my own kids. I loved my life as a child. But that's the time that you're saying, "One day I'll have my own barbecue." In other words, every generation gets to improve on the dreams of the last generation.  
安德鲁斯：哦，更幸福。因为我有了自己的孩子。我小时候的生活很美好。但那是你说“有一天我会有自己的烧烤派对”的时候。换句话说，每一代人都能在上一代人的梦想基础上有所改进。

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Tom Lee, an established lawyer, is talking with Kate Jones, a reporter, about the impact of his childhood on his growth.  
资深律师汤姆·李正在与记者凯特·琼斯谈论童年经历对他成长的影响。

Jones: You had a traumatic childhood. How did it shape who you've become?  
Jones: 你的童年经历了创伤。这些经历如何塑造了你的现在？

Lee: My mother was and is so loving, but she had to work all the time. I had an alcoholic father. I had sisters who married in high school to escape, and I just had absolutely no leadership whatsoever. A lot of what I ultimately defined myself to be was a reaction against that. My dad was beaten and abused by his mother all through his childhoodl. She was a mean woman. I knew what he grew up with and why he was so embittered, but it doesn't make it any easier to live with.  
Lee: 我妈妈非常爱我，但她不得不一直工作。我爸爸是个酗酒者。我有几个姐姐是高中就结婚了逃离家庭，我从小完全没有领导力可言。我最终定义自己的很多东西都是对此的反应。我爸爸在童年时被他的母亲殴打和虐待。她是个刻薄的女人。我知道他成长的环境，以及他为何如此愤怒，但这并不让生活变得更容易。

Jones: Especially when you're a child.  
Jones: 特别是当你还是个孩子的时候。

Lee: He was never abusive with me or my sisters. He drank to escape. We were living in Denver when I was in the fourth, fifth and sixth grades. He was a tool pusher essentially, sold drill bits to oil-drilling companies. He entertained the drillers, the buyers, constantly. So he was out every night, drinking. It got so bad that he either quit or got fired -- as a kid you never know. All of a sudden, we were out of a job. He said, "I'm going to go back to get my Ph.D. in psychology." He was admitted to the University of Oklahoma, so we moved to Oklahoma City. For that period of time, he didn't drink at all. He just quit.  
Lee: 他从未对我和我的姐姐动手。他喝酒是为了逃避现实。我在丹佛读四、五、六年级的时候，他主要是一个工具推动者，给石油钻探公司卖钻头。他经常陪同钻孔工、买家进行娱乐。所以他每晚都出去喝酒。情况变得如此糟糕，以至于他要么辞职要么被解雇——孩子们永远不会知道。突然间，我们失去了工作。他说：“我要回去读心理学博士学位。”他被俄克拉荷马大学录取了，所以我们搬到了俄克拉荷马城。在那段时间里，他完全不喝酒。他戒酒了。

Jones: You must have respected that.  
Jones: 你一定对此感到尊敬。

Lee: I did, but it came with a price because when he was drinking, we had jobs and money. When he quit, we traded alcoholism for being dirt-poor.
Lee: 我是的，但这是有代价的，因为当他喝酒的时候，我们有工作和收入。当他戒酒后，我们把酗酒换成了一贫如洗。

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Phillip McGraw, a famous talk-show `host`, is talking with Laura Yorke, a reporter, about his work and family.  
著名脱口秀`主持人`菲利普·麦格罗正在与记者劳拉·约克谈论他的工作和家庭。

Yorke: You've talked about finding meaning in suffering. What do you mean by that?
McGraw: Everybody at some point is going to have misfortune. I think if we don't learn from that, then it was just a penalty. But if you use it, then it becomes tuition. I draw a lot on my personal experiences. It's hard for people to deceive me, because I'm a pretty street-smart guy. Some husband comes on my show and tries to tell me he's not really a workaholic. I say,"You're talking to one. I've been there."
Yorke: Are there families who come on your show but whom you feel you just can't help?
McGraw: I never think that I'm doing eight-minute cures on television. But I think that 50 percent of the solution to any problem lies in defining it first. I can be an emotional compass that points them down the path, but the real work will start when they walk off the stage.
Yorke: I understand you and Robin and your two sons are an incredibly tight-knit family. What would you say is the greatest value system that you, the McGraws, have? What runs you guys?
McGraw: It may sound dull, but it's really family first. Our family and its priorities, needs, values, come before everything else- work, recreation, whatever. When I say family first, that means marriage also, because our belief has always been that one of the greatest gifts you can give your children is a good marriage between their mom and dad, so they don't wind up living in a divorce situation.
Yorke: How do you feel you've succeeded as a parent?
McGraw: Our approach was that if Robin and I fell off the world tomorrow would our boys be equipped to manage their lives, would they have the values, work ethic and goals-management skills they needed to go forward? I think they would.

## Passage

If a computer were to design the perfect U.N. Secretary General, he or she would look something like this: African born; European and American educated, with decades of service in the U.N. system; married to a European; and possessing a quiet charisma and calm authority as chaos arises.

That the U.N. in 1996 found such a person to restore its sense of direction and purpose was a near miracle. But out of the U.N.'s failures in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda came Kofi Annan, the career international civil servant who had participated in these disasters yet somehow survived and learned from them.

Today Annan is in the middle of his second term. His task is not finished, and the U.N. is still far from what it should be. But Annan has tested the limits of the job, accumulating more authority - one cannot use the word power, given the constraints the U.N. system places on him - than any of his predecessors.

His complex relationship with the U.S. government is little understood. When Annan takes positions in public that are displeasing to the Bush Administration, it unleashes its attack dogs. Yet when Administration officials found their policies in Iraq floundering, they asked the U.N. for help. Some observers told Annan that he should not help the U.S. out of its jam. But he knew that his larger responsibility was to the cause of stabilizing Iraq. He began to work toward the decisive date of June 30, when the U.S. will hand over control to Iraqi authorities and an uncertain situation will prevail. Whether Annan, or anyone else, can succeed in Iraq will be determined by factors way beyond his, or anyone else's, ability to control. But it is Annan's destiny to be handed the very worst problems after they have been unsuccessfully addressed by others. Anyone who knows him knows he wades into such problems with his usual blend of courage, self-control, modesty and optimism.

如果让计算机设计理想的联合国秘书长，他或她可能会具备以下特征：非洲出生；在欧洲和美国接受教育，并在联合国系统内有数十年的服务经验；与欧洲人结婚；并在混乱时展现出静谧的魅力和平静的权威。

1996 年，联合国找到这样一个人来恢复其方向和目的的感觉几乎是个奇迹。但在联合国在波斯尼亚、索马里和卢旺达的失败中，出现了科菲·安南，这位职业国际公务员参与了这些灾难，却在其中存活并从中汲取教训。

如今，安南正在他的第二个任期中间。他的任务尚未完成，联合国仍远未达到应有的状态。但安南已经测试了这一职位的极限，积累了比任何前任都更多的权威——在联合国系统对他施加的限制下，我们不能使用“权力”一词。

他与美国政府的复杂关系众所周知。当安南公开表达与布什政府不合的立场时，会引发强烈反应。然而，当政府官员发现他们在伊拉克的政策陷入困境时，他们又请求联合国的帮助。一些观察者告诉安南，他不应该帮助美国摆脱困境。但他知道，他更大的责任是稳定伊拉克的事业。他开始朝着 6 月 30 日这个决定性的日期努力，届时美国将把控制权交给伊拉克当局，一个不确定的局面将会出现。安南或任何其他人能否在伊拉克取得成功，将由远超他或任何人控制能力的因素决定。但安南注定要在其他人未能成功解决问题之后面对最严重的问题。了解他的人都知道，他总是以勇气、自控、谦逊和乐观的态度迎接这些挑战。

### Section III Reading Comprehension

Read the following texts. Answer the questions by choosing A, B, C or D.

#### 1

Florence Sephton is 77 and lives in Deganwy, North Wales. She is reading for an arts degree. “I’m more of a creature to polish my mind than polish my furniture. The house takes second place while I put the studying first.”

“I was very happy at school and had wonderful teaching. I passed the university entrance examination and was ready to go to university but with World War One I went into banking. I was paid £1 a week. Manchester University kept my place open for three years but I was enjoying the money and the freedom so I turned it down.”

Mrs. Sephton is now in the second year of her Open University course and is finding it hard work. She underestimates her ability. “I’m feeling tired more frequently. I can’t do more than an hour’s work at a time. The memory is shocking. I’m supposed to be revising and I look up notes I did earlier this year and think, ‘Have you read this before?’ So I’m doing it very slowly — one credit a year, so it’ll take six years.”

“At the moment the greatest reward is simply the increase in knowledge and the discipline. I had an essay failed last week. The professor said I hadn’t answered the question. I’ve been thinking about it all week. I know I haven’t got the facility for essay construction. I just let myself go and get excited. I feel more emotionally than I do mentally. I’m very ordinary really.”

While claiming to be ordinary and lazy, Mrs.Sephton is still working hard daily at her assignments. Mrs.Sephton sees her studies as keeping her fit and independent. "Because of my life I've been self-sufficient. It's not a very nice characteristic. It means i don't care enough about people. I can't say i find comfort in what i'm learning, so I'll be interested to see if there's a life ahead."

Florence Sephton，77 岁，居住在威尔士北部的迪甘威。她正在攻读艺术学位。“我更愿意磨练头脑，而不是打理家具。家务排在后面，学习排在第一位。”

“我在学校非常快乐，得到了优秀的教育。我通过了大学入学考试，本来准备去大学，但是一战爆发后我选择了进入银行工作。当时我每周的工资是 1 英镑。曼彻斯特大学为我保留了三年的学位名额，但我当时享受着薪水和自由，所以我拒绝了。”

Sephton 女士目前正在开放大学攻读第二年课程，感到学习很辛苦。她常常低估自己的能力。“我感到疲倦的频率更高了。我一次不能超过一个小时的工作时间。我的记忆力很差。我应该复习，但查看了我今年早些时候做的笔记，我会想，‘你以前读过这个吗？’所以我进展得很慢 —— 每年只修一个学分，这样要花六年时间。”

“目前最大的回报仅仅是知识的增长和学习的自律性。上周我一篇论文不及格。教授说我没有回答问题。我整整一周都在思考这个问题。我知道我没有写作的天赋。我总是让自己情绪激动。我感觉情感上超过了理智。我真的很普通。”

虽然自称普通和懒惰，Sephton 女士仍然每天努力完成作业。她认为学习使她保持身体健康和独立。“因为我一生都是自给自足的。这不是一个很好的特征。这意味着我对人们的关心不够。我不能说我在学到的东西中找到了安慰，所以我会很感兴趣看看未来会是怎样的。”

At political gatherings, he is treated like a pop star. Young girls scream, young men shout his name and everyone from small children to the elderly pushes closer to get a glimpse of the man.

For the last four years, in stadiums and community halls, on farms and on soccer fields, Nelson Mandela has traveled South Africa and the world promoting his vision of racial reconciliation. His tireless campaigning and his insistent commitment to the cause of non-racialism have won him a Nobel Peace Prize and made him a global symbol of hope in the post-Cold-War era of ethnic conflicts and instability. But now with the election behind him, Mandela must transform the dream that has sustained him into the reality of a new, multi-racial South Africa.

In the four years since he emerged from prison, he has led the push for democracy with a determination and vision that have left his leadership unchallenged. Although he lives in a suburb of Johannesburg, where the upper class lives, he has retained the respect of his country's poor masses. He has met with the general staffs of both the South African defense force and the national police force, which some suspect has secretly cooperated with white extremists, and also held talks with leaders of the right wing. Talking to foreign reporters last week, Mandela said he does not intend to ban the extremist white organizations; the way the former government banned his organization, the African National Congress. At the same time, however, Mandela made it clear that he will not tolerate disobedience in his government.

Tall and dignified, with the erect bearing of a king, Mandela seems destined to become the President. "Right from the outset Nelson had a presence; he always made an impression on anybody that met him because of his sincerity and strong will," says one activist who has known Mandela since the 1940s, when he emerged as an energetic young figure on the political and social scenes.

在政治集会上，他被当作流行音乐明星般对待。年轻女孩尖叫，年轻男子高呼他的名字，从小孩到老年人，每个人都争相靠近，想一睹这位男子的风采。

在过去的四年里，Nelson Mandela 走遍了南非和世界各地的体育场、社区大厅、农场和足球场，推广他的种族和解愿景。他不知疲倦的宣传和坚定不移的非种族主义承诺使他赢得了诺贝尔和平奖，并成为了后冷战时代种族冲突和动荡时期的全球希望象征。但现在选举已经结束，Mandela 必须将长久支撑他的梦想转化为新的多种族南非的现实。

自从他从监狱中出狱四年来，他以坚定的决心和愿景领导推动民主进程，其领导地位无人挑战。尽管他居住在约翰内斯堡的一个富人区，他仍然赢得了自己国家贫困群众的尊敬。他会见了南非国防部和国家警察部队的总部人员，一些人怀疑他们秘密与白人极端分子合作，并与右翼领导人进行了会谈。上周对外国记者讲话时，Mandela 表示，他不打算像前政府禁止非洲国民大会那样禁止极端白人组织。然而，同时，Mandela 明确表示他不会容忍政府内的不服从命令。

Mandela 身材高大，举止庄重，如同国王般的仪态，似乎注定要成为总统。“从一开始，Nelson 就有一种存在感；他因为他的真诚和坚强的意志，总能给遇到过他的人留下深刻印象，”一位从 1940 年代起就认识 Mandela 的活动家如是说，当时他作为政治和社会舞台上精力充沛的年轻人物浮出水面。

### Section IV Writing

Write an essay of 120 words on A Real Friend. Your essay should include:

1. different views about what a real friend is
2. your opinion of a real friend
3. the way to find a real friend

---

A real friend is often defined through various perspectives. Some view a real friend as someone who offers unwavering support through tough times, while others emphasize shared interests and experiences. In my opinion, a real friend is both a pillar of strength during challenges and a source of joy in moments of celebration. They are trustworthy, honest, and genuinely care about your well-being. Finding a real friend involves investing time and effort in building meaningful connections. It requires openness, empathy, and the willingness to listen. Genuine friendships develop organically, often rooted in shared values and mutual respect. Ultimately, a real friend stands by you through thick and thin, offering understanding without judgment, and enriching your life with laughter, companionship, and unconditional support.

---

What is a real friend? some people think that real friendship lies in generosity. Some others think a real friend is one with whom they can share happiness.  
In my opinion, however, a real friend is one who is with you when you are in difficulties. He is ready to offer you help whenever you need it, and gives his advice even if you don't like to hear it. A friend in need is a friend indeed.  
It takes a great effort to get a real friend. First, we should be kind and honest to others. Second, do not hesitate to offer our helo when others need it. A sincere and frank person is never worried about finding a real friend.

### Section V Speaking

#### Part 1

Look at the pictures about four different people: computer engineer, architect, model, and teacher. Suppose they are your friends. Describe and introduce each of them to your partner.

---

Sure, here's how I would introduce each of them:

1. **Computer Engineer Friend**: Meet John, my friend who's a computer engineer. He's passionate about coding and technology. He's always up-to-date with the latest gadgets and software trends. John's a problem solver, so whenever I have tech issues, he's my go-to person. Besides his tech-savviness, he's also a great cook and loves hiking on weekends.

2. **Architect Friend**: This is Sarah, my architect friend. She has an eye for design and loves creating spaces that are both functional and beautiful. Sarah's creativity is inspiring, whether she's sketching new ideas or discussing sustainable architecture. Outside of work, she enjoys visiting art galleries and volunteering for community projects.

3. **Model Friend**: Meet Emily, my friend who's a model. She's not just stunning on the runway but also incredibly down-to-earth. Emily is passionate about fashion and loves exploring different styles. She's also into fitness and enjoys yoga and swimming to stay active and balanced.

4. **Teacher Friend**: This is Mark, my friend who's a teacher. He's dedicated to his students and passionate about education. Mark always has interesting stories from his classroom adventures and loves discussing new teaching techniques. Outside of school, he enjoys playing guitar and is a big fan of board game nights with friends.

Each of them brings something unique to our group of friends, and I think you'll enjoy getting to know them!

#### Part 2

Look at the picture showing a young man complies with the old man in speech but disobeys in his heart. Describe the picture and make a comment.

---

In the picture, a young man is depicted listening attentively to an elderly man, nodding respectfully as if he agrees with what is being said. However, his facial expression and body language suggest a disconnect between his outward compliance and inner disagreement or reluctance. The elderly man, who appears to be speaking with authority or wisdom, seems unaware of the young man's true feelings.

This scene highlights a common social dynamic where outward respect or compliance is shown out of courtesy or obligation, yet true agreement or alignment with the spoken words may be lacking. It raises questions about sincerity, communication, and the complexities of interpersonal relationships, where understanding and genuine connection can sometimes be masked by surface-level gestures.

Commenting on such a scenario prompts reflection on the importance of authenticity in interactions. Genuine communication involves not only listening respectfully but also expressing one's thoughts and beliefs honestly, fostering deeper understanding and mutual respect in relationships.
