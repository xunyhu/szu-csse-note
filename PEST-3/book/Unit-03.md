## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Clyde and Harry are friends. They are talking about work and family.

    Harry: I've taken over as chief consultant for all of our East Coast offices, Che 领袖, you know. I took on so much work that I hardly have time for my own family.

    Clyde: That's a big job! Is Betty happy about that?

    Harry: To be honest with you, Clyde, she isn't pleased at all. Because she's a working mother, she thinks I ought to help her take care of the kids and the housework.

    Clyde: You're in the same spot I was in when Patricia went back to work 点 after the baby was born. She soon called my attention to the fact that she couldn't work full time and keep house, too. I decided a 决定 change of plans was called for, and I began coming straight home from work to help her out. Now while she feeds the baby, I wash the dishes or even cook the meal. I don't think we men spend enough time with our kids.

    Harry: Never thought much about stuff like that. I guess I just took it for granted that a wife was supposed to take care of her kids and husband. I didn't think about them needing me - except to bring home the paycheck.

    Clyde: They do need you, Harry, especially the kids. You can't just take it for granted that they know you love them. You've got to get to know them.

    Harry: Well, Itold Betty that it was her job to rear the kids, but maybe I'd better take that back and give her a hand.

    Clyde: You can't change everything all at once, though. Take your time. Adjust your schedule so you can be at home more. Get Betty to take off on some trips with you. I'll bet her mom would take over the house for her.

    Harry: Maybe you're right.

    Clyde: Believe me, you won't regret it. It's a real challenge to take on, Harry, but the kids won't wait. They'll be grown and gone before you know it.

    Harry: Thanks for the advice, good buddy.

    克莱德和哈里是朋友。他们在谈论工作和家庭。

    哈里：我已经接管了我们所有东海岸办公室的首席顾问职位，知道吗？我承担了太多的工作，以至于几乎没有时间陪自己的家人。

    克莱德：那是个大职位！贝蒂对此满意吗？

    哈里：说实话，克莱德，她一点也不高兴。因为她是一名职业母亲，她认为我应该帮她照顾孩子和做家务。

    克莱德：你现在的处境和我当初帕特里夏生完孩子回去工作时一样。她很快就提醒我，她不可能全职工作又照顾家里。我决定改变计划，下班后直接回家帮她。现在，当她喂孩子时，我洗碗甚至做饭。我觉得我们男人花在孩子身上的时间不够。

    哈里：从没想过这些事情。我只是理所当然地认为妻子应该照顾孩子和丈夫。我没想过他们也需要我——除了我带回家的工资。

    克莱德：他们确实需要你，哈里，尤其是孩子。你不能理所当然地认为他们知道你爱他们。你得了解他们。

    哈里：嗯，我告诉贝蒂那是她的工作，养育孩子，但也许我应该收回这话，帮她一把。

    克莱德：不过，你不能一下子改变一切。慢慢来，调整你的时间表，这样你可以更多地待在家里。带贝蒂出去旅行。我敢打赌她妈妈会帮她照看家的。

    哈里：也许你说得对。

    克莱德：相信我，你不会后悔的。哈里，这确实是一个真正的挑战，但孩子们不会等你。在你意识到之前，他们就会长大离开。

    哈里：谢谢你的建议，好朋友。

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Tami is paying a short visit to Jennifer, her mother-in-law.

    Tami: I was going by the store near your house and thought of stopping for a few moments before going on home.
    Jennifer: I'm glad you did! Come on in! How are things going?
    Tami: Just fine. David and I have been invited to a formal dinner at his boss's home. But I have no idea what I should wear.
    Jennifer: If I were you, I'd wear the light blue dress David brought back from London. Your black purse and shoes go nicely with that dress.
    Tami: But I can't wear that dress. Forget it!
    Jennifer: Why not?
    Tami: Because it's too short. I need a more modest dress.
    Jennifer: When David goes abroad, he always brings back nice dresses for you. Let's see.. Maybe the white dress you wore for New Year's.
    Tami: I guess that will do! I really am lucky to have David. He's so thoughtful! He always goes beyond my expectations.
    Jennifer: Since this is a formal dinner, the kids can't go along with you. Would you like me to baby-sit for you?
    Tami: Sure! Your offer goes to prove that you're a wonderful mother-in-law.

    塔米：因为它太短了。我需要一件更保守的连衣裙。
    詹妮弗：大卫出国时，总是给你带回来漂亮的连衣裙。让我想想……也许你可以穿你在新年时穿的那件白色连衣裙。

    拉里：嘿，黛布，我们去看电影吧。我真的很想看部好喜剧。再说，你已经在这些账单上忙了好几个小时了。
    黛布：你真是不可理喻！
    拉里：为什么！
    黛布：我们没有钱出去。
    拉里：哦，别这样。
    黛布：难道我没告诉过你我们几乎入不敷出吗？我说的所有话都是左耳进右耳出。
    拉里：好吧。听着，给我个机会，好吗？我最近一直在努力减少我们的开支。我离开房间时都关掉灯；我一直在记录我们的电话账单……
    黛布：嗯，也许是这样，但你每天都把暖气调到70华氏度，这每月多花了我们70到80美元。
    拉里：等一下，等一下，我必须这样做。你知道每次温度低于68华氏度时我都会生病，黛布，你知道的。

    黛布：但是他们收了我们五个电话的钱。
    拉里：五个？
    黛布：嗯，我得打电话给他们让他们解决这个问题。

## Passage

On the day the World Trade Center fell, the EmpireState Building once again became the tallest buildingin New York City.
In the months that followed, six of itscommercial tenants ran off. They did not want to be in the tallest anything,anywhere, anymore.
At a time when U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney was stillbeing shuttled around to undisclosed locations, skyscrapers suddenly seemedlike the most disclosed locations.  
For a while, it looked as though the tallbuilding, at least in the U.S., might be one more casualty of war.
Three years later, despite fears of terrorist attacks, big is beautiful again.  
On July 4, New York Governor George Pataki and New York City Mayor MichaelBloomberg presided at the groundbreaking for the Freedom Tower, the officebuilding that will rise at the World Trade Center site.  
New skyscraper projectsare under way once more elsewhere in the city and around the U.S.  
Meanwhile,outside the States, where the taste for tall buildings never really faded, theskyscraper has also been poking its head up in very different ways, and not justfor reasons having to do with security.  
Since the early 1990s, tal buildings havebeen reshaped by a number of global architecture stars whose vision is finallybeginning to penetrate the more conservative American market."

翻译如下：

    在世贸中心倒塌的那一天，帝国大厦再次成为纽约市最高的建筑。
    在随后的几个月里，它的六个商业租户逃离了。他们不再想待在任何地方的最高建筑中。
    在美国副总统迪克·切尼仍被转移到未公开地点的时候，摩天大楼突然显得像是最显眼的地方。
    有一段时间，至少在美国，高楼看起来可能是战争的又一个牺牲品。
    三年后，尽管有对恐怖袭击的担忧，大建筑再次成为美丽的象征。
    7 月 4 日，纽约州州长乔治·帕塔基和纽约市市长迈克尔·布隆伯格主持了自由塔的奠基仪式，这座办公楼将矗立在世贸中心原址。
    纽约市及美国其他地方的新摩天大楼项目再次启动。
    与此同时，在美国之外，对高楼大厦的喜爱从未真正消退，摩天大楼也以非常不同的方式冒头，而不仅仅是出于安全原因。
    自上世纪 90 年代初以来，一些全球建筑明星重塑了高楼的形象，他们的愿景终于开始渗透到更加保守的美国市场。

Some of the best examples of that rethinking now fill two large galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's temporary outpost in Queens, New York. Using 25 spectacular architectural models (some more than 4 m high), 'Tall Buildings', a show that runs at MOMA through Sept. 27, looks at the ways in which the skyscraper has evolved since the early 1990s, at least in the hands of its most gifted practitioners, the kind who are proposing — and even producing, but usually in other nations — buildings that don't resemble the dull boxes that crowd many American downtowns."

"Engineering is, among others, a path to new kinds of beauty. Just look at Renzo Piano's London Bridge Tower, a slender glass pyramid that forms a glittering stalagmite against the old city's skyline. You get a grasp of what ingenious engineering is all about from the London headquarters of the insurance firm Swiss Re, designed by Norman Foster. Even before it opened in April, it was known as the small cucumber because it rises against the sky like a green pickle. But the building's signal feature is the inclusion of large interior gardens throughout."

"But there's a dematerializing spirit even in a building that didn't require new feats of engineering — the Arcos Bosques Corporativo in Mexico City, an arched tower with a vertical slot down its center that lightens the building's mass and brings the sky itself into play. "Not only did America invent the skyscraper," says the Spanish designer Santiago Calatrava, "it invented the skyline." But American skylines have got a little dull. With some work, the world's architects might bring them back to a very tall standard."

翻译如下：

    如今，这种重新思考的最佳例子之一填满了纽约皇后区现代艺术博物馆临时分馆的两个大型展厅。通过25个壮观的建筑模型（有些超过4米高），展览“高楼大厦”展示了自20世纪90年代初以来摩天大楼的演变，至少在其最有才华的从业者手中，这些人提出并甚至在其他国家建造的建筑不再像许多美国市中心拥挤的呆板盒子。展览将持续到9月27日。

    “工程学是通向新型美学的一条途径。看看伦佐·皮亚诺设计的伦敦桥塔，这是一座纤细的玻璃金字塔，在古老的城市天际线上形成了闪亮的钟乳石。通过诺曼·福斯特设计的瑞士再保险公司的伦敦总部，你可以了解巧妙工程的全部含义。甚至在它于4月开放之前，它就因为其外形像一个绿色的小黄瓜而得名。但这座建筑的标志性特点是包括了多个大型室内花园。”

    “但即使在不需要新工程壮举的建筑中也有一种消隐的精神——比如墨西哥城的Arcos Bosques Corporativo，这是一座中心有垂直槽的拱形塔楼，减轻了建筑的质量，并让天空本身也参与其中。‘美国不仅发明了摩天大楼，’西班牙设计师圣地亚哥·卡拉特拉瓦说，‘还发明了天际线。’但美国的天际线已经变得有些乏味。通过一些努力，世界各地的建筑师可能会将它们恢复到一个非常高的标准。”
