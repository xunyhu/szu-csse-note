## Dialogue/Monologue 1

Lisa Callahan, director of the Women's Sports Medicine Center, is now being interviewed by Morin, a reporter, on the right form of physical exercise.

- Morin: Dr. Callahan, it seems that people are terribly mixed up about the right kind of exercise. Do they need long workouts to get the benefit, or will short, intense ones do the trick?
- Lisa: Oh, what should people do depends on their health history, their weight and their goals.
- Morin: What should they do if their cholesterol is going up steeply?
- Lisa: Jog several miles each week, and be brisk enough-3 to 4 miles per hour.
- Morin: If they have more than a few pounds to lose?
- Lisa: Well, for those overweight people, an hour or more a day is recommended; otherwise, the extra pounds will raise the risk of disease.
- Morin: If they are concerned about bone loss?
- Lisa: Pick up those weights. Physicians recommend that most people-but particularly women-get 2 or 3 days a week of weight training. This has extra benefits, like building bone mass.
- Morin: What is the right exercise for those people who are at a normal weight, who are in good health and want to maintain it?
- Lisa: For these fortunate folks, 30 minutes of moderate activity, 5 to 7 days a week, is enough. Do this and their risk of disease declines, no matter their age, sex, or race. They'll get substantial benefits, including a 50 percent reduction in heart attack, a lower risk of colon cancer, and probably a lower risk of breast cancer and Type II diabetes."

丽莎·卡拉汉（Lisa Callahan）是女子运动医学中心的主任，现正接受记者莫林（Morin）的采访，讨论正确的体育锻炼形式。

- 莫林：卡拉汉医生，似乎人们对正确的锻炼方式感到非常困惑。他们需要长时间锻炼才能获得好处，还是短时间高强度锻炼也可以？
- 丽莎：哦，应该怎么做取决于他们的健康史、体重和目标。
- 莫林：如果他们的胆固醇急剧上升，该怎么办？
- 丽莎：每周慢跑几英里，并且步伐要足够快，每小时 3 到 4 英里。
- 莫林：如果他们需要减掉不止几磅的体重呢？
- 丽莎：嗯，对于那些超重的人来说，每天锻炼一小时或更长时间是推荐的，否则额外的体重会增加患病的风险。
- 莫林：如果他们担心骨质流失呢？
- 丽莎：举起那些哑铃。医生建议大多数人，特别是女性，每周进行 2 到 3 天的重量训练。这还有额外的好处，比如增加骨质密度。
- 莫林：对于那些体重正常、健康状况良好并希望保持健康的人，什么是正确的锻炼方式？
- 丽莎：对于这些幸运的人来说，每周进行 5 到 7 天，每次 30 分钟的中等强度活动就足够了。这样做，他们的疾病风险会下降，无论年龄、性别或种族。他们会获得实质性的好处，包括心脏病发作风险降低 50％，结肠癌风险降低，并且可能降低乳腺癌和 II 型糖尿病的风险。

## Dialogue/Monologue 2

Linda is asking Robert, an expert in air pollution, about the indoor polutionsources and their harmful effects on human health.

- Linda: Robert, can you tell me what causes indoor air problems?
- Robert: Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into theair are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes.Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels. Hightemperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrationsof some pollutants.
- Linda:What are the pollutant sources?
- Robert: There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home, suchas oil, gas, coal, wood and tobacco products; building materials andfurnishings; products for household cleaning and maintenance,personal care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems andhumidification devices.
- Linda: What are the immediate effects of indoor air pollution on people'shealth?
- Robert: Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure or repeatedexposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat,headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects areusually short-term and treatable.
- Linda: How about their long-term effects?
- Robert: Long-term effects may show up either years after exposures or onlyafter long or repeated periods of exposure. These effects, whichinclude some respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer, can be serious and fatal."

琳达正在询问空气污染专家罗伯特关于室内污染源及其对人类健康的有害影响。

- 琳达：罗伯特，你能告诉我是什么导致了室内空气问题吗？
- 罗伯特：室内污染源释放的气体或颗粒物是家庭室内空气质量问题的主要原因。通风不足会增加室内污染物的水平。高温和湿度水平也会增加某些污染物的浓度。
- 琳达：有哪些污染源呢？
- 罗伯特：任何家庭中都有许多室内空气污染源，如石油、煤气、煤、木材和烟草制品；建筑材料和家具；家用清洁和维护产品、个人护理或爱好用产品；中央供暖和制冷系统及加湿设备。
- 琳达：室内空气污染对人类健康的直接影响是什么？
- 罗伯特：直接影响可能在一次暴露或多次暴露后出现。这些包括眼睛、鼻子和喉咙的刺激、头痛、头晕和疲劳。这些直接影响通常是短期的且可治疗的。
- 琳达：那它们的长期影响呢？
- 罗伯特：长期影响可能在暴露多年后或仅在长时间或反复暴露后才会显现。这些影响包括一些呼吸系统疾病、心脏病和癌症，可能是严重的甚至是致命的。

## Dialogue/Monologue 3

Listen to a radio report for places famous for longevity.

There are several places in the world that are famous for people who live a very long time.

Hunza is high in the Himalayan Mountains of Asia. There, many people over one hundred years of age are still in good physical health. Men of ninety are new fathers, and women of fifty still have babies. What are the reasons for this good health? Scientists believe that the people of Hunza have these three benefits:
(1) physical work, usually in the fields or with animals;
(2) a healthful environment with clean air and water;
(3) a simple diet high in vitamins and nutrition but low in fat, cholesterol, sugar, and chemicals.

People in the Caucasus Mountains are also famous for their longevity. In this area, there are startling examples of very long-lived people. They not only live a long time, but they also live well, they are almost never sick, and when they die, they have not only their own teeth but also a full head of hair and good eyesight.

Vilcabamba, Ecuador, is another area famous for the longevity of its inhabitants. This region is also in high mountains, far away from cities. In Vilcabamba, too, there is very little serious disease. One reason for the good health of the people might be the clean, beautiful environment: the temperature is about 70"F all year long; the wind always comes from the same direction; and the region is rich in flowers, fruit, vegetables, and wildlife.

Experts found that inhabitants in the three regions have more in common than calories, natural food, their mountains, and their distance from modern cities. Because these people live in the countryside and are mostly farmers, they endure and even enjoy considerable physical hardship. Thus, they scarcely have the worries of city people. Their lives are quiet. Consequently, some experts believe that physical exercise and freedom from worry might be the two most important secrets of longevity.

听一段关于长寿之地的广播报道。

世界上有几个地方以人们长寿而闻名。

位于亚洲喜马拉雅山脉高处的洪扎（Hunza）就是其中之一。在那里，许多百岁以上的人仍然身体健康。九十岁的男子是新爸爸，五十岁的女子还在生孩子。那么，这种健康的原因是什么呢？科学家认为，洪扎的人拥有以下三大优势：
(1) 体力劳动，通常是在田野或与动物一起工作；
(2) 一个健康的环境，拥有干净的空气和水；
(3) 一个简单的饮食，富含维生素和营养，但低脂肪、低胆固醇、低糖和低化学物质。

高加索山脉的人们也以长寿著称。在这个地区，有许多长寿的惊人例子。他们不仅长寿，而且生活质量也很好，他们几乎从不生病，去世时不仅有自己的牙齿，还有一头浓密的头发和良好的视力。

厄瓜多尔的维尔卡班巴（Vilcabamba）也是一个以居民长寿著称的地区。这个地区同样位于高山上，远离城市。在维尔卡班巴，也很少有严重的疾病。人们健康的一个原因可能是清洁、美丽的环境：全年温度约为 70 华氏度；风总是从同一方向吹来；而且该地区富含花卉、水果、蔬菜和野生动物。

专家发现，这三个地区的居民除了热量、天然食物、他们的山区和远离现代城市之外，还有更多的共同点。由于这些人生活在乡村，主要是农民，他们忍受甚至享受相当大的体力劳动。因此，他们几乎没有城市人的烦恼。他们的生活很安静。因此，一些专家认为，体力锻炼和无忧无虑可能是长寿的两个最重要的秘密。

## Dialogue/Monologue 4

Dr. Hans Selye was the first physician to document the effects of stress on the body. He is now talking about the healing power of stress.

Humans should not try to avoid stress any more than they would keep away from food, love or exercise. While there's no question that prolonged stress is harmful, several studies suggest that challenging situations in which you're able to rise to the occasion can be good for you.

In a 2010 study of 158 hospital nurses, those who faced considerable work demands but coped with the challenge were more likely to say they were in good health than those who felt they couldn't get the job done.

Stress that you can manage may also boost immune function. In a study at the Academic Center for Dentistry in Amsterdam, researchers put volunteers through two stressful experiences. In the first, a timed task that required memorizing a list followed by a short test, subjects believed they had control over the outcome. In the second, they weren’t in control: They had to sit through a horrible video on surgical procedures. Those who did well on the memory test had an increase in levels of certain antibody (the body’s first line of defense against germs). The video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody.

Stress prompts the body to produce kinds of hormones. In short bursts these hormones have a positive effect, including improved memory function. But in long bursts these hormones can have a harmful effect on the body and brain. It's the occasional burst of stress of brief exposure to environmental or physiological stress that could be protective.

汉斯·塞利（Hans Selye）博士是首位记录压力对身体影响的医生。他现在正在谈论压力的治愈力量。

人类不应试图避免压力，就像他们不会远离食物、爱情或锻炼一样。虽然毫无疑问，长期压力是有害的，但几项研究表明，在能够迎接挑战的情况下，具有挑战性的情境可能对你有好处。

在 2010 年的一项对 158 名医院护士的研究中，那些面临大量工作需求但能应对挑战的护士比那些觉得无法完成工作的护士更有可能表示自己身体健康。

可控的压力还可能增强免疫功能。在阿姆斯特丹牙科学院的一项研究中，研究人员让志愿者经历了两种压力体验。第一种是计时任务，需要记住一个列表并进行简短测试，受试者相信他们可以控制结果。第二种他们无法控制：他们必须观看一段关于手术程序的恐怖视频。在记忆测试中表现良好的受试者体内某种抗体（对抗病菌的第一道防线）的水平增加。而观看视频的受试者则经历了抗体水平的下降。

压力促使身体产生各种激素。在短暂的压力下，这些激素会产生积极影响，包括改善记忆功能。但长期的压力下，这些激素会对身体和大脑产生有害影响。偶尔的短期压力或对环境或生理压力的短期暴露可能具有保护作用。

## Passage

Being young has universal appeal and today people are searching for the qualities that youth comprises: good health, mental alertness, physical attractiveness, vigor - in a word, fitness. Fitness is the magical term we have pervaded our daily lives via the media, television and radio. Newspapers suggest to be slim, do exercise. In fact, the latest nutritional programs are devoted to fitness information. It is almost impossible to find a general interest magazine that doesn't feature easy diet and exercise programs. Fitness books are widely available in bookstores and libraries. Countless professionals advocate being slender, doing exercises, and feeling energetic.

The intense interest in the condition and appearance of the body has generated a steady flow of highly marketable innovations. Consumers spend billions of dollars annually on health foods, personal care products, and sign up for lifetime memberships in clubs like national gyms. People shop in health food stores for organically grown goods and dietary supplements to add extra vitamins to their diets.

For many years, it has been the practice of giant corporations to maintain a gym or health club for the exclusive use of their executives. By working out at these facilities, top management could release some of the tensions generated at work. Membership in these corporate facilities was, and still is, a symbol of status. However, a new attitude is emerging. Employees are burdened with tensions and pressures, and may benefit from this type of recreation. Studies indicate that improvement in physical and mental fitness contributes significantly to employee productivity. Fewer sick days also mean a financial gain for the company. Therefore, it is essential for major corporations to offer health club memberships to all their employees. This concept is revolutionary, but it is begin considered seriously. There is no doubt about it: when people are physically fit, they are at their best. It makes sense to maintain optimum health in order to live life to the fullest.

年轻具有普遍的吸引力，如今人们正在寻找构成青春的品质：良好的健康、敏锐的思维、身体的吸引力、活力——总之，健身。健身是一个魔力词语，通过媒体、电视和广播渗透到我们的日常生活中。报纸建议保持苗条，进行锻炼。实际上，最新的营养项目都致力于提供健身信息。几乎不可能找到不提供简单饮食和锻炼计划的综合类杂志。健身书籍在书店和图书馆里广泛可得。无数专业人士倡导保持苗条、进行锻炼和感觉充满活力。

对身体状况和外貌的强烈兴趣产生了源源不断的高度市场化的创新。消费者每年花费数十亿美元在健康食品、个人护理产品上，并注册全国健身房等俱乐部的终身会员资格。人们在健康食品店购物，购买有机种植的商品和膳食补充剂以增加饮食中的额外维生素。

多年来，大公司一直为高层管理人员维持健身房或健康俱乐部，通过在这些设施中锻炼，高层管理人员可以释放工作中产生的一些紧张情绪。在这些公司设施中的会员资格曾经也是一种地位的象征，至今依然如此。然而，一种新的态度正在形成。员工也面临着紧张和压力，可能从这种休闲活动中受益。研究表明，身体和心理健康的改善对员工生产力有显著贡献。减少病假也意味着公司的财务收益。因此，重要的大公司为所有员工提供健康俱乐部会员资格是必不可少的。这一概念是革命性的，但正在被认真考虑。毫无疑问：当人们身体健康时，他们处于最佳状态。保持最佳健康以充分享受生活是有意义的。

### Section III Reading Comprehension

Read the following text. Answer the questions by choosing A, B, C or D.

    Didi Manahan glanced at a photograph of herself one day and was shocked at how much weight she had put on. "My arms were enormous and my chest looked larger than it ever had been," she recalls. "I looked like a pregnant woman."

    Manahan couldn't ignore reality when it was facing her straight on. She was almost 40, and was going to have soft loose flesh.

    It wasn't hard to figure out why. After working as the director of a preschool all day, all she wanted to do was to go home and relax. Exercise was the last thing on her mind. But Manahan paid a high price. In addition to putting on weight, she felt tired and stiff much of the time. After some reflection, she realized that lack of exercise would deprive her of vitality and good health - things she wanted to enjoy well into old age. It was time to get moving.

    Inactive people are 40 percent more likely to die younger. Those who do exercise lower their risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, stroke and some other diseases. A 2010 study also concluded that regular exercise can protect against mental decline.

    'It is best to start as early as possible because the older you get, the harder it is to establish good exercise habits,' advises Dadi Riyanto, technical director of the Singapore Fitness Professionals Federation. 'With each passing decade, it's tougher to keep the kilos off and muscles toned,' she says.

    Now Didi Manahan goes swimming with her niece and nephew, and joins them in tennis playing. She has cut down on social eating and meets up with friends who are physically active. Her exercise routine includes working out at the gym three times a week, short- and long-distance running once a week each, basketball and badminton once a week each.

    Manahan no longer feels stiff and tired. She has lost about 10 kilos and looks much better, with a faint but definite sign of muscle definition on her upper arms.

    Is it possible that Manahan's fat is shifting to muscle? She hopes so, because she wants to be energetic and independent for decades to come. 'I met a 72-year-old man while running my first marathon,' she says. 'I want to be strong and fit like him when I reach his age.'

    迪迪·马纳汉（Didi Manahan）有一天瞥见了一张自己的照片，震惊于自己增了多少体重。“我的手臂很大，胸部看起来比以前任何时候都大，”她回忆道。“我看起来像一个怀孕的女人。”

    当事实直面对她时，马纳汉无法忽视现实。她几乎 40 岁了，身体已经开始变得松弛。

    要弄清楚原因并不难。作为一名幼儿园园长，工作一整天后，她只想回家放松。锻炼是她最后考虑的事情。但马纳汉付出了高昂的代价。除了增重，她还经常感到疲倦和僵硬。经过一些反思，她意识到缺乏锻炼会使她失去活力和健康——这是她希望能够享受的，直至晚年。是时候动起来了。

    不活跃的人死亡率增加 40%。而那些锻炼的人降低了患心脏病、高血压、癌症、中风和其他一些疾病的风险。一项 2010 年的研究还得出结论，定期锻炼可以防止精神衰退。

    “最好尽早开始，因为年龄越大，建立良好的锻炼习惯就越难，”新加坡健身专业联合会技术总监达迪·里扬托（Dadi Riyanto）建议道。“随着每个十年的过去，保持体重和肌肉紧致变得更难。”她说。

    现在，迪迪·马纳汉和她的侄子、侄女一起游泳，并与他们一起打网球。她减少了社交聚餐，并与活跃的朋友见面。她的锻炼计划包括每周三次去健身房，每周各一次的短跑和长跑，每周各一次的篮球和羽毛球。

    马纳汉不再感到僵硬和疲倦。她已经减了约 10 公斤，外表看起来好多了，上臂有了些微但明显的肌肉线条。

    马纳汉的脂肪是否可能在转化为肌肉？她希望如此，因为她希望在未来的几十年里保持精力充沛和独立。“我在跑第一次马拉松时遇到了一位 72 岁的老人，”她说。“当我到他这个年纪时，我希望像他一样强壮和健康。”

Read the following texts from a magazine article in which five people talkedabout how they quit smoking. For questions 6 to 10, match the name of eachperson(6 to 10) to one of the ways to quit(A to G)given below.

David：  
Many people were simply scared by the goal that they would not smoke forever.So what I did was I promised myself I wouldn't smoke at all for just one week.This limited time was a more reasonable goal than "forever". It was a roughweek, but it passed! Then I promised another week's no smoking. At the end ofthe second week, my longing for cigarette was gone.

Tom：  
When I was trying to quit smoking, I was very irritated. I often flared up for noreason at all. To get more understanding and help, I informed all the people Iassociated with, like family, co-workers, and so on, that I was engaged in thisproject and that I might be a little impatient.

Bill：  
During that period of transition from being a smoker to a nonsmoker, I often felt restless, and cigarettes were the only thing on my mind. So I kept myself very busy. I did exercises, took long walks, visited friends, made or fixed things with my hands. Chewing gum and drinking plenty of water also proved very helpful.

Joe：  
Since the gradual as well as the abrupt method of quiting smoking caused suffering, many people advised me to endure this pain for a shorter duration. To do it, I joined a group having the same goal. We encouraged and helped each other. It took much discipline, but with enough willpower, many of us succeeded in becoming a nonsmoker.

Bob：  
To quit smoking was really suffering. I got all the symptoms of irritability, tension, difficulty in concentrating, fatigue, tendency to overeat, inability to sleep and intense longing for another cigarette. So when I weakened and had to have a cigarette, I did not stop one. I had many - enough to make me sick. In this way, within four weeks almost all symptoms disappeared, along with the longing for cigarette."

Sure, here's the translation:

阅读以下来自杂志文章的文本，其中五个人谈论了他们如何戒烟。对于问题 6 到 10，请将每个人的姓名（6 到 10）与下面的戒烟方式（A 到 G）进行匹配。

David：
许多人对于不再吸烟的目标感到害怕。所以我做的是，我承诺自己只在一个星期内不吸烟。这个有限的时间比“永远”更合理的目标。那是一个艰难的一周，但它过去了！然后我又承诺了第二个星期不吸烟。到第二个星期末，我对香烟的渴望就消失了。

Tom：
当我试图戒烟时，我非常烦躁。我经常无缘无故地发火。为了获得更多的理解和帮助，我告诉所有与我有关系的人，如家人、同事等，我参与了这个项目，并且可能会有点不耐烦。

Bill：
在从吸烟者过渡到非吸烟者的期间，我经常感到焦躁不安，而香烟成了我唯一关心的事情。所以我让自己非常忙碌。我做运动，长时间散步，拜访朋友，用手制作或修理东西。嚼口香糖和喝大量的水也非常有帮助。

Joe：
由于逐渐戒烟和突然戒烟都会带来痛苦，很多人建议我忍受这种痛苦的时间较短。为此，我加入了一个有相同目标的小组。我们彼此鼓励和帮助。这需要很多纪律，但只要有足够的意志力，我们许多人成功地成为了非吸烟者。

Bob：
戒烟真的很痛苦。我出现了所有的症状，如烦躁、紧张、注意力不集中、疲劳、倾向于暴饮暴食、失眠以及对另一支香烟的强烈渴望。所以当我虚弱时不得不吸烟时，我不会只吸一支。我吸了很多 - 足以让我感到恶心。通过这种方式，几乎所有的症状在四个星期内消失了，渴望香烟也随之消失。

Dear Thomas,

I understand your concerns about heart disease, especially given your family history. However, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk.

Firstly, maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting saturated fats and sugars.

Secondly, engage in regular exercise such as jogging, swimming, or even brisk walking for at least 30 minutes a day.

Lastly, keep a good state of mind by managing stress through activities like meditation, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones.

By incorporating these habits, you can significantly lower your risk of heart disease.

Best regards,
Wang Lin

Dear Thomas,

Sorry to heat that your parents are suffering from heart disease and you are much worried that you would probably catch the same disease. Actually there are plenty of ways to reduce the risk of having disease, especially by modifying your lifestyle. Here are some heart-healthy steps you can take: eat more fruits and vegetables and fewer processed foods and less fat; cut out cigarettes; exercise more (ideally, 30 minutes of moderate effort a day). But most important of all, you should always try to reduce stress and keep a good state of mind, because prolonged stress and depression can increase the risk of heart disease. So if you are depressed, get support or treatment as necessary. I'm sure you will be as healthy as i am if you adopt a healthy lifestyle.

Best wishes.
Wang Lin

### Section V Speaking

**Part 1**

Look at the pictures of four types of physical exercises: weight-lifting, jogging, swimming and Taijiquan. Tell which one is your favorite exercise and explain why.

---

Among the four types of physical exercises—weight-lifting, jogging, swimming, and Taijiquan—my favorite is swimming.

Swimming is a low-impact exercise that provides a full-body workout, improving cardiovascular health and building muscle strength without putting stress on the joints. It's an excellent way to stay fit and maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, swimming is refreshing and can be quite relaxing, offering both physical and mental health benefits. Being in the water helps me feel calm and rejuvenated, making it an enjoyable and sustainable exercise routine.

**Part 2**

Look at the picture showing a street lined with dirty snack bars. Deacrible the picture and make a comment.

---

The picture shows a street lined with dirty snack bars. The snack bars have run-down exteriors with peeling paint and faded signs. Litter is scattered along the street, and the area appears neglected. The overall atmosphere is unclean and uninviting.

Comment:
The state of these snack bars highlights the need for better hygiene and maintenance standards. Dirty and neglected food establishments not only create an unpleasant environment but also pose health risks to customers. It's important for local authorities and business owners to prioritize cleanliness and regular upkeep to ensure a safe and welcoming space for everyone. Improved conditions would attract more customers and contribute positively to the community's well-being.
